AFA367Z5MOI5XVW7IAQJS7OGXKMA,B0B8DZ7H5F,4,"This is an ok lip balm/gloss. I probably would think of it more as a gloss than a balm or butter. It has a unique flavor and scent, which is different than any others that I own. The formula is not too thick or sticky and is easy to apply. It leaves a nice shine. My lips feel moisturized for a little while, but I don't feel like it has any lasting hydration. I prefer a thicker lip balm if that's what I'm after. I'll use this more for the shine than the moisture.",It's fine,2022-11-08 12:04:52.696

AEPS33MI7LANKDAHRYF2MRKNYTIQ,B0914JBBTV,5,"Biore Cleansing oil make-up removing clothes come in a plastic box of 44 and are made in Japan.  At first, my wife thought that these are small and thin, but she found that one was sufficient to remove makeup and mascara, with mascara top coat (which can be challenging to remove with other wipes).  My wife has tried several brands before, including top-rated wipes, and all of them except for this one irritates her skin slightly.  These do not!  Her skin is pretty tough, and she doesn't usually have reactions to cosmetics.<br /><br />There is a label on the inner package with Japanese writing, that's not translated into English on the package.  It says to make sure to use the plastic box to store the wipes to ensure quality and peel off the sticker completely; don't remove the wipes from the bag; make sure to close the lid after use.  I'd suggest that the manufacturer add a translated version on the package.  The package says to use the entire package within 45 days after opening, so if you don't wear make-up every day, you may not finish the package before they start to dry out.<br /><br />My wife loves these!

AGXMWJK3YL4SV5FJ27JEJZPZHRBA,B097H7H3MT,5,"The order of the Korean exfoliating bath wash cloth comes in 6 pieces. There are four with the same size and two that are a little bit longer in length.  If you are familiar with the traditional korean scrubs, they are sized much smaller (See attached photo for size comparison. Dark green vs light green from another brand). I love the ones I ordered because I can fit all of my hand and it will cover more surface area than the old one I use. I can scrub away fast and more with this product.<br /><br />The exfoliating bath wash cloths are very lightweight and dries easily. Traditionally, I use them after sitting in the sauna or a hot bath. The dead skin easily peels away using these scrubs. Because I don't live near a Korean sauna, I just use these on the daily in the showers. I prefer using these over any loofah.

This one is a little chunkier than most and feels rougher on my skin. It is also quite oily. I like some oil in my scrubs for moisturizing, often I don’t even need to apply lotion after using, but this one seemed extra oily and left the shower slippery. It separates, so needs to be shaken or stirred before using.

I stopped using it and then tried another eyelash product after the symptoms ended. The same thing began to happen while using the other product.<br /><br />Here is the thing though, I don't know if it is the eyelash serums that cause, as the air is full of seasonal change and fires. Besides a tiny tingle when using the product, nothing else pointed out that my reactions are the products.

AFB5L26ZMR3M5IXB3TR7NBTIFEYA,B08NC4378M,5,"This Plant Therapy Natural Acetone Free Nail Polish Remover has a strong scent that fades. It works quickly and well on Sally Hansen regular, non-gel nail polish (the only one I’ve tested it with so far). For the record, I have wimpy, prone to peel and/or snap off, pathetically weak fingernails that get worse when I use acetone on them. This remover was surprisingly good, although I don’t think it’s natural at all.<br /><br />PROS:<br />• It took off three layers in a matter of seconds and left what seemed to be an oil residue that wiped off easily.<br />• I immediately applied fingernail polish again, and it applied and stayed on perfectly, even though my fingernails had just been oily from the remover.<br />• The dispenser worked really well, although I had to be careful to not push too hard. Just a light push gave me enough remover.<br />• The remover didn’t seem to damage or dry my nails in any way; it actually left my nails seeming moisturized or refreshed. Acetone, on the other hand, definitely dries my nails and makes them brittle.<br /><br />CONS:<br />This polish remover is not a natural product. It’s still a chemical soup. Maybe it has a more natural beginning (I’d like to see them explain it), but the ingredients require a degree in chemistry to divine their origins:<br /><br />Ingredients: methyl acetate, isopropyl mistrate, and natural fragrance.<br /><br />Frankly, I love that it works so well and doesn’t damage my nails. I just wish manufacturers wouldn’t put “natural” (or “plant therapy”) on products that aren’t. Subtracting one star for that misleading marketing strategy.<br /><br />Overall, very, very pleased with this Plant Therapy Natural Acetone Free Nail Polish Remover so far. Since I’m trying to keep my nails longer to play the kalimba (well, technically, I only need my thumbnails) by keeping them painted, I’m very happy to find a fingernail polish remover that doesn’t destroy my nails!<br /><br />As the parent of kiddos with autism, there are causes near and dear to my heart.

AHPG65LKS3QKRWDUWAKZNLEK5RZQ,B08VNP9MKF,4,"This is a good set. The colors are great and a nice variety. One might think the wattage low on light but consider, it is also an LED light so they are more powerful. I still prefer a higher wattage. But even after doing any nails, they are a tad tacky. This is because with gel polish, one must take a wipe or cotton ball with your acetone, or I prefer alcohol. And wipe over nails gently. This is the very last step after top coat and curing. This takes the tackiness away. Won’t mess up polish either. I wish the bottles showed color on them. It must be a thing with gel polish. To protect from light.",Great set,2022-03-04 01:37:57.487

AELWIBSJORE5MM722A4OQC53XIWA,B0B2L218H2,4,"I've sampled an earlier version of Pinrose's petals before and wasn't really impressed with the tiny square they used to use (as shown in the product photos). It looks like they got smart with this newer version by having a folded up, soft, fragrance wipe (about 6'x6"") in each packet. It definitely makes for a much more versatile sampling experience. I generally prefer using fragrance on the back of my neck and on my collarbones and the wipe was great for that as well as running it over my hair, arms, back of the knees, etc. It's ultimately not strong but I was amazed at the staying power (6+ hours)!<br /><br />Initially I didn't care for Gilded Fox as a scent. It was very masculine straight out of the package and the cacao note was more bitter than I was expecting. Once it was on my skin and there was a bit of a dry down coming out I fell in love.","If you like Thierry Mugler's Angel, NEST's Cocoa Woods, or Elizabeth and James' Nirvana Bourbon.",2020-11-22 04:12:51.989
AE3IGJOPJP6LFXEJTIXFJVSJLILA,B086VYKNDF,4,"I got this hoping I'd be able to use it to soothe my skin post-radiation treatments.  Sadly, I did not notice that this is not 100% Aloe Vera gel as was recommended by my doctor.  It is ""100% organic and natural"", for whatever that's worth.  At least Aloe Vera is the first listed ingredient.  It also contains Vitamin C and E which might be OK but  Hyaluronic acid is hardly what I'd want to put on tender, inflamed skin from radiation.  I'm not even sure I'd want to use this on a sunburn.<br /><br />So anyway, I've used it on other parts of my body that weren't zapped by radiation instead.  I like the smell.  It moisturizes well and the pump dispenser is easy to use.  However, it leaves my skin feeling kind of sticky.

AGPCJNECQMG7LPLITZVHXP3F2HUA,B085TFXLH1,5,"Pine gel nail polish smells great, looks amazing, and lasts a long time.  The dark blue is our favorite color and we love that you can get the deep color with great glitter and shine using just one coat, on top of the base coat.  There are no base or top coats included, but as long as you have them, the set, along with a nail clipper and file is all you need to have salon quality manicure and pedicure.  The magnet included with the kit is rectangular, as shown, and is effective at making long streaks on the nails.  With some practice, you’ll be able to create very defined cat eyes, but make sure you keep the cure lights right nearby, or you’ll lose the streaking.  Additionally, make sure that you buff the nails lightly, clean the nails thoroughly, and run full cure times if you want to have the nail polish last more than two weeks.  Following this simple procedure will hopefully give you a high quality and long lasting finish like I have experienced.

I can't deal with the whole false lashes thing, I don't do well with glues, and the magnetic ones don't seem to stay on well. When I tried this mascara I was hoping for fuller looking lashes and that's what I got! I do two coats and that does the trick for me.

Even when I used a brush I could still see a thin layer of the gel on my tiles.  This made me very nervous as the box says that if you touch the gel you should monitor yourself for sickness.

The video made it look so easy, but now that I have watched the video again I see that they cut away before showing the final bun.  That's because it is nearly impossible to make a neat bun on your own with this product.  You need a second person to help shape the bun and to tie off the ends.  Even wrapping the hair is a mess.  I have long wavy smooth hair and it always looks untidy, messy, and loose with this product.  I made a decent bun for my daughter, but she complained it was pulling her hair.  No way she could wear it to school.<br /><br />The concept is good.  You put your hair through the middle, start wrapping by twisting in 2 directions, and tie it off.

You can smell it from the outside of the bottle as soon as it arrives. But don't smell it straight from the bottle, or on your cotton round... the solvents themselves have a very strong odor! After you use the product though, the only thing lingering is the fruit punch scent on your fingertips. There is a little bit of an oily residue left behind, but it beats the ashy dryness of straight acetone.<br /><br />The leak-proof pump bottle works amazing! If you knock the bottle over, it does not spill. I love that! The cap on the bottle flips up to reveal the pump dispenser, which you press down to pull your liquid to the top. I did not have any issues during shipment, so I think this bottle will be fabulous for travel. This acetone-free formula removes traditional crème & shimmer polishes with little effort. The solvent base contains Ethyl Acetate & Isopropyl Mistrate. I wouldn't use this as my first defense against removing glitter lacquers, and I wouldn't use it to soak off gel polish at all. (Pure acetone is best for both of those options).<br /><br />Plant Therapy products are proudly made in the USA! 🇺🇸",Smells like Hawaiian Punch 😋 Great formula and I love the no-spill pump bottle!,2021-03-31 00:13:53.253

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,B0B4MR9BXN,3,"This comes in a nice outer product box. Made in Korea. The brand’s website said it’s 100% vegan, excluding animal ingredients and animal experiments. It also doesn’t include parabens.<br /><br />It comes in a nice compact. It’s a compact like a cushion foundation where you open it and there’s a kind of lid that holds the sponge applicator, and you lift that lid to reveal the product. You press the applicator sponge into it (or your own sponge or brush) and then apply it. The brand’s website said the included sponge applicator is an “eco puff” made of “eco-friendly corns” and is “99.9% anti-bacterial and water-repellent,” which makes it safe on skin and keeps puff clean.<br /><br />This is a liquidy but balm kind of texture. It isn’t as thick as a balm. It just feels like a cushion foundation. But this isn’t a foundation. It has a very light, mint green color to it. It’s so light that it’s almost white but has the green color to it. When applied, it reduces redness. It doesn’t do as well as my more pigmented green correctors, but it does a nice job while being hydrating and lightweight on the skin. It’s something that works well before applying foundation. It is lightweight enough to wear well under foundation. It isn’t a primer really, it doesn’t smooth out the skin or fill in pores. But, it does reduce the redness in my skin so then I use less foundation and concealer. If you have a TON of redness or it’s REALLY red, this might not be enough since it isn’t extremely pigmented. But, it will make a difference. I like it isn’t drying on the skin either.<br /><br />I’m just not sure how I feel about it though. It works well on the skin. But, I do like to know what’s in my products. I don’t like that they provided barely any product info, and the ingredients on the product box weren’t in English. They also didn’t include them here on the product page. Not even the product photos provided any real info on the product - what it does, who it’s for, how to use it, ingredients, etc. I had to go to the brand’s website to find out more. Yes, it’s a simple Google search, but it’s not really something you  should have to do.<br /><br />Normally, I would just go to the brand’s website to find the list of ingredients when they’re not included on the Amazon product page. But, the Jung Saem Mool website didn’t have them on their website either. I looked for them elsewhere and did find an ingredient list on Korean Beauty Box, but didn’t think they were accurate because they didn’t include centella asiatica, pine sprout, or green calamine powder, which are supposed to be in this product. So, I translated the ingredients from the box myself. But, I’m not that confident in the ingredients provided on the box.(I included a photo from the box, and also included the ingredients at the end of my review in English)<br /><br />It doesn’t seem like a complete list of ingredients to me. It has the first ingredient as titanium dioxide. It has tocopherol (vitamin E) as the 3rd ingredient. The rest of the ingredient are 7, kind of versions I’d guess you’d call them, of centella asiatica. There’s nothing else listed. It’s kind of odd. The brand’s website said this is supposed to have “2 plants - pine sprout containing fresh moisture and centella asiatica roots.” I saw the “centella asiatica roots” in the ingredients when I translated them. But didn’t see any “pine sprout.” I also saw something about “cica pine water” on the brand’s website, but again, not sure what that’s supposed to be? The brand’s website also mentioned “Natural green calamine powder covers reddened skin tone.” Again, I didn’t see any calamine powder at all in the ingredients.<br /><br />The 7, I guess versions, of Centella Asiatica are:<br />Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm) - Well known soothing, antioxidant, and moisturizing ingredient. Anti-inflammatory. The main biologically active components are Asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid. All of which are in this.<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm)<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm)<br /><br />Madecassoside (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica. It’s less prominent than it’s sister component, Asiaticoside, but it still contributes to the well-established moisturizing and wound healing abilities of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Overall, it works well. It reduces my redness, feels hydrating on the skin, and works well on its own and under foundation. It feels lightweight on the skin. If they provided the full ingredient list, it would be something I’d be willing to purchase. But, right now, I don’t like they didn’t include them and don’t like that they can’t even be found online as far as I could tell. And I just have a hard time believing the ingredient list I translated from the box is the full ingredient list. I don’t know. If the ingredients aren’t a big factor for you, this is nice and works well. If knowing the ingredients are important to you, I’d look elsewhere. There’s other similar products that actually provide a full ingredient list, and a lot of them are far cheaper. I give it 3 stars.<br /><br />How to Use (from brand’s website):<br />Use as last step of skin care routine. Dip puff into content and gently apply and dab on skin.<br /><br />Special Tips (from brand’s website)<br />Carry it in makeup bag or purse for easy supply of moisture to skin when it dries up.<br />Use as lightweight skin tone corrector to correct sensitive skin tone covered by masks instead of applying heavy, caking makeup.<br /><br />FULL INGREDIENTS<br />Ingredients | Titanium dioxide (CI 77891], Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm), Tocopherol, Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm), Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm), Madecassoside (0.0025ppm), Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm), Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm), Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm)<br /><br />**NOTE: Just for reference, 1ppm = 0.0001% (or 10,000 ppm = 1%). So…<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm) = 515.9235%<br />*5,159,235ppm is parts per million, so it means there’s 5,159,235 parts of Centella Asiatica in one million molecules<br />Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm) = 0.0000035%<br />Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm) = 0.000003%<br />Madecassoside (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%<br />Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%<br />Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%<br />Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%","Reduced redness & hydrating, but need ingredient list in ENGLISH!",2022-10-26 17:23:58.080

AFUKCEULW4KYMWRQCVGI6K3WTVUA,B07QN8CGPL,4,"I was a little leary about a spray but it feels so refreshing to spray on.  It also makes it much easier to use a light amount.  Considering the light amount you use, the size of this bottle is going to last FOREVER.  This really makes me more likely to use it daily vs just when going out.  It really does make a nice smooth surface to apply makeup to and reduces the powdering or blotchy look of your makeup.<br /><br />Do not let “moisturizing” fool you though, this isn’t like a bb cream, you do still need a separate moisturizer.  Also keep in mind it is “minimizing”, it doesn’t make your pores magically and completely disappear, especially if you have any enlarged pores.  It works great on my chin and forehead to reduce pores but I have some enlarged pores on my nose that it doesn’t touch.<br /><br />I’ve used other primers that work slightly better but at a MUCH higher cost so I save them for going out vs every day.  I think this makes a good every day primer.  And since I still use a separate moisturizer that has spf I don’t have to worry about this not having it.

Include your neck if you like.<br />Then with each passing moment, it's going to get foamier and foamier. That's why you have to have a very thin coat. You only need a small amount of product. If you use too much, your face is going to foam up like you have shaving cream all over!<br /><br />After about 5 or 10 minutes, you massage a little bit with warm water and then rinse. After you dry your face it's going to feel squeaky clean. If you have dry skin, you're ready for a moisturizing serum and cream. If you have oily or acne prone skin, use the appropriate products for that skin type. I don't feel that this mask is drying, but it does leave you very clean.<br /><br />So, in my opinion, this is good for all skin types, as long as you use it as a brightening mask as opposed to a hydrating mask.<br />This is just what your skin needs if you have overdosed on hot humid weather.please look at the ingredients to see if you have any sort of allergy or if any of them are a trigger for any skin issues.

AHF2R43HMV6S2J42LN6NLQTRBLJA,B08GKHQ9P1,5,This is my second set of these brushes I originally got these for my middle daughter and we keep one in her bathroom and one in the kitchen for the times I put a hair mask in her hair and use these combs to get the tangles out and the product into each part of her hair up to her root. So when my oldest seen these and I used them in her hair she was like ok I want one now too and then I also thought these would be great for my son who also has tons of hair and curly hair at that. So now everyone has one and I think I may sadly be getting another set for my daughters when there at their dads house too. They love these brushes and I have to attest using these to comb thru their hair makes things a world easier and less of a hassle I do wish they had a grip on the handle for wet hands but really outside of that I dont have any complaints. These come in packs of 2 and even if you dont have kids using one in a purse and keeping one home is enough reasons to get these especially if you have thick hair these are amazing. My kids are mixed and range from hair length to neck length to butt length and I will tell you these are amazing at handling getting thru those thick tangles. The back has a piece that allows you to have the comb itself at different firmness I like the top one personally it is the firmest level. Overall if I am not a fan I dont know who is but I know for sure I have 4 and I will have 6 by the end of the year.,"Great quality, works great for thick,long,curly hair, and works wonders",2020-12-10 07:09:26.976

My skepticism was quickly diminished after trying this for just a few days. I typically shower every morning and I have Vitamin C and Retinol that I apply to my face. So, when I got this I put it in the freezer and followed the instructions. So, instead of just applying the serums to my face, I started using this roller along with the serums. After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall. I think applying this roller to my skin allows the pores to absorb the serums faster and deeper. I will continue to use this going forward.

For each bottle they supply you with a pump dispenser which is great. It makes it so much easier to dispense the oil without making a mess to be honest. Both oils are claimed to be organic which is nice. This will run you $25 which in my eyes is a good deal.<br /><br />These oils can be used direct for skin care and as carrier oils, meaning you can add some essential oils to them to make your own custom oil blends. The oils themselves were pretty much fragrance-free which was a bit disappointing to me, but makes sense since these are often used as carrier oils. When you use this they are pretty lightweight and absorb quickly. I found they do leave the skin a bit greasy, but that is not a surprise since these are oils. That feeling does go away within about 15 minutes or so, so not too bad. All in all a good deal","Good basic oils, many uses",2020-12-22 17:10:12.284

AGPGFFJDCKXPNBWCC5YP2ZUDPNGA,B085TFXLH1,5,"This set of gel polishes from Pine Gel really blew me away! These cover in one easy coat and have a nice glossy finish. The glitter polish was a little bit thick, but it's packed with glitter so I guess that's to be expected. This set of six shades contains (1) Glitter, (3) Crèmes, (2) Magnetics, and a cats eye magnet wand needed to work the magnetic polishes. All of the colors cure for 60 secs in an LED lamp or 90 secs in a UV.<br /><br />The crèmes are all buttery smooth in application, and self level beautifully. Each dry down to a nice glossy finish. The magnetics are easy to manipulate with the enclosed magnet stick. I was able to do a double cat eye line on my first try! (These are gonna be a lot of fun to play with using different shaped magnets for different effects.) Both magnetic polishes covered completely in one easy coat. The glitter shade is jam-packed with small royal blue glitters and is accented with a sprinkling of medium sized blue hexagons. The depth and sparkle to this polish is incredible. The glitter load makes this shade a little bit thick - but it's still workable. None of these gel polishes have a bad odor. None of them gave me any issues during application or the curing process. I cannot speak to the wear time, as I always use a peel-off base coat or full coverage tips, with gel polish products.<br /><br />Because these are so rich in pigment, (and a lot of them are dark colors), it is best to work in thin coats. They do cure with a sticky layer. All of these (except the glitter) cured for 60 sec in my LED lamp. With the thickness and opacity of the glitter polish, I did a double cure on that one to be safe. All swatches in this review are ONE coat and are shown WITHOUT top coat.<br /><br />I think the coverage, formula, and finishes of these polishes is amazing and absolutely worth the price.

AEKWD5653VPVL7PHTDABCF5V7JCQ,B014DH4FTC,5,"Next on the Valentia beauty line, comes the True Glow Eye Cream for review. I use eye creams and serums on a daily basis and twice a day because I find this area tends to reflect signs of aging sooner than the rest of my face. My goal is to always keep this area hydrated and moisturized at all times because of this!<br /><br />Valentia's True Glow Eye Cream comes in a glass bottle with a pump action top. The product advertises as being an Intense Corrective Eye treatment, which not only works as a preventing regimen but also aids with current issues. The eye cream helps with:<br /><br />Reducing Fine lines and Wrinkles<br />Restoring Radiance by helping repair and nourish the delicate skin around our eyes<br />Hydration from oils to Anti-inflammatory ingredients to reduce puffiness that may further diminish the appearance of aging skin.<br />Tightening the area around the eye by aiding with elasticity and targeting dark circles. which can make a person look tired and cause an irregular skin tone/color effect to the area.<br /><br />Retail Price Point: $25.00 via Amazon for a 1.18 ounce glass bottle with a pump action top.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />I always give myself about 3 to 4 weeks when it comes to trying any beauty creams and serums. I need to know if the effects I experience belong to the product I am testing or they are just the remaining benefits from the one prior. I can then also get an idea how well a product performs! The first week of trying the eye cream from Valentia, I noticed the product tends to linger longer on the skin than my former eye cream. As much as I love quick absorbing products, my prior eye cream left no residue but also no hydrating protective layer. It would just vanish within four hours and if the day was even breezy in nature, I could feel that tight feeling your skin gets when it's drying out too much. The True Glow Eye Cream from Valentia left a protective layer that kept my skin looking smoother longer through out the day. I used the product twice a day and experienced zero irritations from use. The thin layer allowed for make-up application after and no odd little rolled up residue balls formed hours later, or worse, when your make-up separates making it look like you forgot to blend. None of that happened! I did not notice fine line repair by week three, but I can state that the product is phenomenal went it comes to working as a prevention aid. I looked more awake because the skin in that area was smooth and naturally plump, not swollen from my seasonal allergies! My eyes water at night and when I sleep, creating what I call &#34;teary eyes&#34;. I get red streaks from the irritation if I forget to apply eye cream or applied a poorly formulated one. I can state the Valentia's True Glow Eye cream prevented any red marks from setting in, so I woke up looking fresh and not like I have been weeping! This is an eye cream I would continue to use but also along with the Ultra Plumping Hydrating Mask from Valentia. These two products help each other out and I get a balanced appearance that is noticeable with this duo.<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from Valentia. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.",Valentia : True Glow Eye Cream Review,2016-03-01 00:19:14.000

I’ve used several different brands of similar eye masks, and these are noticeably thicker and more substantial than every other pair I’ve tried! Even at room temperature, they instantly provide a cooling sensation when applied to the face. They adhere well to skin, but due to their weight and size, they do have a slight tendency to slip downward with gravity. For that reason, I suggest lying flat or reclining while wearing them, so that they stay as close to the lower lash line as possible. Each package still contains some extra serum after the eye masks are removed, so I massage that residual liquid onto my neck for added moisture potential. The combination of hyaluronic acid, collagen, and 24k nanogold particles leaves my under eye area feeling incredibly hydrated and refreshed.

This soap has coconut oil, olive oil, potassium soap, aloe juice, vitamin E, citrus acid, sodium chloride and a natural essential oil blend (not in that order). I assume “potassium soap” is potassium hydroxide (caustic lye), but believe it’s found in all liquid soap under various names.

There is a tiny instruction pamphlet included.<br /><br />The flat iron feels good in my hands. I like that the cord swivels at the base so that it does not tangle.<br /><br />This did an okay job on my hair. I have fine medium length hair and this mostly relaxed my curls so that my hair was more wavy that fully flat. I set the temperature to 300 for fine hair. I also tried 350.<br /><br />There are several things that make this iron just okay for me. First, it is weird to have the temperature controls between the flat iron blades. There is a constant temperature key and also temperature plus and minus keys, in case the constant temperature key is not set.<br /><br />The power button should be pressed to start setting the temperature and then when the LCD stops flashing, it has reached that temperature. Then the power button has to be pressed again so that the light in the middle of the plate lights up.<br /><br />The plates have some space between them and they are offset a bit from each other which is the biggest annoyance to me. I guess this is why it straightened my hair only so much. This is not a bad flat iron but it is not perfect either.",This flat iron gave me mild straightening results; plates have too much space between them,2018-12-20 00:19:59.508
AHWCZ47A7FIYEJ7KEJG3BO3F5YXQ,B07JGD2T2J,4,"My husband used this kit and took, when asked to do a bit of a review on it for me, took it very seriously. The price isn't cheap so he wanted to make sure to really look at everything as he used it. Here is what he had to say:<br /><br />""You have a pack of accessories here so I thought I would run through them in turn to tell you what you are getting and my impression of it<br /><br />Shampoo and body wash.<br />Okay, I ran through this way too quick and used all of it. It's good. It's really good and I couldn't really get enough of it. So that's a plus and a negative in that there isn't really a lot of it to begin with.<br /><br />Face wash.<br />I love to get In there and give my face a right good scrubbing. This helps. The wash is thick and gel like with the exfoliating, and it does feel like you have given your face a good scrub after use. You do feel cleaner after use.<br /><br />Shave cream<br />I'm not one for using cream very often. I prefer basic foam from a can. But wow. This stuff leaves your face feeling clean and fresh after shaving.  Not only that but incredibly soft.<br /><br />Moisture cream<br />This is really not something I use at all. I would think it best to use after shaving because you are stripping moisture from your face, but in that regard the shave cream is sufficient. I just don't personally have a need for a separate moisture cream. So it is sort of hard to form an opinion about it.<br />What I can tell you is that it doesn't really have a scent, my face does feel super soft. On the downside it is a little messy and I found myself wiping away the excess.<br /><br />For the most part then I really like this set. It comes in a handy pouch you can use long after the accessories are empty. However, that won't take too long because the bottles are very small. It's something for people who aren't concerned about the cost. It's very expensive. Is it worth the cost for me? Not really. Not in terms of either quality or quantity but if the price was lower I would be recommending to everyone.""<br /><br />There you go guys and gals. That's what he thought about the set. He's still talking about it so he did like it, just thought it was a bit much.",Nice grooming set,2020-09-27 18:54:29.958

They do provide a plastic cylindrical piece to aid in doing so. I’m a nurse, so I’m used to breaking open these kinds of ampoules without any issue. I can imagine that some people would not like this though<br />-Watery serum that glides across skin easily<br />-Honestly, a little seems to cover a large area of skin. 2ml may not seem like a lot, but a single ampoule seems like way more than would be needed for one application. I have split one into 3-4 uses to be honest<br />-I’m assuming the company intends for one whole ampoule to be used as one application because each one is labeled as day 1-7, and they provide no way to seal an ampoule back after using which I found to be rather frustrating<br />-Absorbs rapidly and doesn’t feel sticky or tacky after drying like the collagen concentrate did<br />-Their collagen concentrate ampoules also had a heavy fragrance, so I was SO relieved to find that there is no added fragrance with these<br />-Made in Germany<br /><br />So does it really help with plumping, smoothing, and reducing wrinkles? I don’t know. I definitely like the way my skin looks and feels right after application, but I haven’t noticed anything drastic.<br />As I previously stated, the 2ml of serum feels like A LOT to me if you try to put it all on your face at once. Unfortunately, this company also does not provide a way to seal an individual ampoule back for future use since they apparently intend for one ampoule to be an entire application. I remember I tried a set by the ISDIN brand with glass ampoules just like these. In the kit, the company included a top to slide over the opened glass ampoule with a cap to seal for future use. This was awesome and so convenient. I was disappointed to find out that this company did not include anything like that (I took a picture of that top and cap on one of these ampoules so you can see).<br /><br />Anyway, it is possible that this product may provide good results when used long term, but I just don’t really like this being intended for use over 7 days only. If they included a top with cap to seal each individual ampoule so that the product could be used over a longer period of time, I would like it much more. I would definitely prefer a serum in a larger bottle with dropper lid.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know – thanks!

It's turned out to be mostly a great product.<br /><br />It comes in a lovely package. The minimalist package coloring, as well as the design of the dispensers, makes a very attractive presentation. The dispensers are also easy to use, and pleasant to hold. It would make a lovely gift.<br /><br />This product is very effective. My wife has now used the entire supply. She says that the wash is smooth to apply, easy to cover her face with it. It washes off quickly, resulting in what she calls a ""renewed"" sensation. Following the wash, she uses the moisturizer, and says it soaks into her skin naturally, leaving a very nice, non-oily feeling. However, my wife does not like the strong scent. She has experimented with the moisturizing oils that come with this. She says they definitely moisturize nicely, and she only needs a couple of dabs of the oils for nice effect. They do better than the scented cream in many ways, but she says they would not be great every day.

They almost have to melt off and I much prefer the easier removal of Kiss pink nail glue. Great Nails! They work well with uv nail gel polish. However, the top coat is a must have for a shiny finish. Usually, I wear them as they are without polish. These are white nails. They can last one to three weeks. I rough up my nails and wipe with alcohol before using nail glue to glue them on.

AHBDPVXHGNIRMIGLCRCABCOLFJTA,B08FD2KP9R,5,"I recently started using one of these with loofa on it. It works for me, even if loofa does take a while to break in. However, it also absorbs quite a bit of soap. I like this one much better.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to order it. How would silicone feel against my back? It turns out that it feels fine and works well. I like that it needs much less soap since it doesn't absorb it. Instead of spreading it all over the thing - I like the side with little bristles like a brush - all you need is to put some in the center. Moving the brush over your back spreads the soap out nicely and does the job without a lot of waste. It squeaks a bit on un-soaped skin, but that's pretty easy to get over and doesn't last long. It was just a surprise, initially. It feels like a gentle scrub, and that's the important part. It also rinses off easily and dries quickly, an important point here in our humid climate. The interior relative humidity in our house hovers around 55% in the summer, so things can get moldy fast. That's what usually happens if a loofa or any other kind of absorbent surface isn't dried properly. I just hang this up on the thoughtfully provided suction hooks and forget about it.

The eyelashes themselves are beautiful and I love the lengths. The liner is easy to put on and so are the lashes. And, they stay on very well, with one exception.<br /><br />The eyelashes are too wide for my eyes, and I need to cut the last magnet off for them to fit properly. But, when I do that the outer end flips up and makes the lashes look terrible. If I don't cut them, they stick into the inner corner of my eyes, causing major irritation and immediately flip up, also making them look terrible. <br />I feel like they need one more magnet on the outer end, close to the last magnet. Because, most people need to trim any and all eyelashes, in order to make them fit their eyes better. In every video I've ever watched with glue on lashes, the person always has to trim the eyelashes just a little bit shorter in width. Why didn't the manufacturers of these eyelashes think that it would not be the same for these lashes?<br /><br />I love the concept, and really wish that these worked for me, because I have very dry eyes and cannot wear eye makeup and mascara.

I started using Liquid Gold almost two weeks ago (just in time for a cold front and a huge snow storm) and I don't recognize my skin. I use Liquid Gold in the morning and right before bed every day. A little of it sits on the surface of my skin, but it never offsets on my pillow or clothing. After a half hour or so, it's completely absorbed. I'm 56, so I've been watching my skin go through all kinds of hormonal acrobatics, from rosacea to acne to uneven texture and coloring. Does Liquid Gold eliminate all of these flaws? No. But it DOES alleviate them and help improve my skin texture (no painfully dry papery skin! Blast the heater in the car-- I don't care!). The proof that this stuff works for me, though, is that I feel comfortable enough in my own skin to go out without makeup on most days.

I've tried perfumes that cost $150 more than this that I didn't like half as much.

My husband also said he really liked it, so that's a win! The only thing I don't love about it is the cheap looking plastic lid on the bottle. It really cheapens the look of the bottle and doesn't snap on well, which is kind of a pain. I thought about just throwing it away, but then if I travel with the bottle I'm afraid it will spray all over my bag.

These don't stick, like at all. There is a small amount of stickiness that lasts for mere seconds before these things fall off their surface (I've tried plastic, acrylic, skin, hardwood, and even carpeting to see). Honestly I was pretty surprised that these didn't stick to my carpet fibers. You can see in my photo that  I used these for nail art, and the lifting is visible. I held the stickers down when I noticed them lifting from the nail, but after a 30 seconds of holding the sticker down (onto a top coat, too) the gorgeous little butterflies lifted anyway.<br /><br />I want to give this product more stars so badly. The three stars I have given are for the aesthetics alone, while the other two stars are missing because the product does not really work the way it is intended to.

First of all, this thing is much larger than any other slicker style brush I have. This is a great feature for my large dog, but it was just ridiculous trying to groom my cats with this large, unyielding wire brush. So, not a good choice for the cats.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not a good choice for my dog either, as she has a short coat with little to no undercoat and she was really uncomfortable with wires dragging on her skin. She's more of a rubber curry comb type gal, I guess. Besides the size and wire bristle problems, the plastic itself felt a little brittle and cheap and when you add in the mechanics of retractable bristles... I think higher quality material would have been a better choice because that slider for the bristles is very basic. Finally, while I loved the idea of the easy-to-clean retractable bristles, they really aren't necessary and if those wires become crooked or bent it will cause all kinds of problems with the retraction. I've made it decades by just pulling the fur out of my slicker brushes-- it literally takes 2-3 seconds-- and while the thought of retractable bristles is nice, it totally isn't necessary. It's not a practical tool for me and doesn't work for any of my animals due to its size and the wire bristles.

It’s thick enough to not require much product but not so thick that your razor is instantly gummed up. I’ve also used Pacific Shaving Company oil (too thin) and Shave Secret oil (too thick). Since this is an oil, I don’t often use it for moisturizing but it’s very effective in that capacity particularly if you have a very dry and stubborn area. I’m giving this product 5 stars because it works great for all it’s intended uses but the reality is that I’m unsure how often I will purchase it due to it’s high price. I will have to wait and see how long a bottle lasts. So far a little bit goes a long way so it very well may end up being worth the high price.",works fantastic but pricey,2014-02-15 21:01:55.000

AH5OTJDIHBG4SYLRYWKS7MR7NWUQ,B077YR3333,4,"When I first looked at this Phytema Anti-Aging Hydrating Serum, I thought it looked so weird for a serum, and then, when I put a little on my skin, I wasn’t so sure I was going to like it at all.  My first reaction was that I didn’t want to use it. Not only did it feel a little thick and sticky, there were those micro-beads in there that felt strange for a serum. I honestly thought, at first, that maybe I’d received a facial wash with scrubbing beads, but when I added water to it, it didn’t lather or foam.<br /><br />I looked up the product online and found the French company who makes this serum and other beauty products. I was a little reassured so I decided to give it another try.<br /><br />I applied a little of the serum on the back of my right hand. What amazed me is that once it sinked into my skin, the skin of my right hand took on a glow. I’m a skeptic when it comes to beauty products—the claims companies make don’t often pan out or are exaggerated—but I could see it, and still do, that glow/illumination on my right hand versus my left hand, and over 30 minutes later it is still there. I love that glowing aspect of it.<br /><br />As for softness, I really don’t see any difference from this product and others but that doesn’t bother me. What I am interested in is how it is illuminating my skin as advertised. As for what other claims the company says the serum does, that’s a little more difficult to determine except with continued use over time, but if I like how a serum feels and if it gives my skin that glow, then I’m happy enough to try it and see what happens.<br /><br />There is no irritation to my skin, no burning, itching, redness.<br /><br />The beads do soften onto the skin as you apply it. Here’s what the company says about how to apply (which is kind of a weird different way to apply it-I still want to do the circular thing!): ‘Apply with the flat of the hand, without making circular motions, but starting from the middle of the face towards the outside of the face, to explode the jojoba micro-beads and to release the vitamins E and C on your skin.’<br /><br />It is a little difficult to apply a serum onto your face with the flat of your hand, but I did try patting it with my fingers and that worked better.<br /><br />It will feel sticky when you first apply it, and you can feel those beads. However, the stickiness goes away and the beads do melt onto your skin.<br /><br />The price isn’t shown on Amazon. I looked up the price on the company’s website and it’s $49.90 Francs (I am assuming it’s Francs), and that’s only about $8 in American dollars. So I don’t know what the final price will be here on Amazon or how they’ll do that. I’d pay a decent price for this serum just for that glow.<br /><br />It is advertised to be partially organic and mostly natural. The company’s advert reads: ‘99.85% natural ingredients of which 28.79% organic. Phytema ™ Skincare Radiance Serum is an ultra-concentrated anti-aging, anti-radical & anti-stain active ingredient. All the effectiveness of white mulberry, cucumber and bearberry, to prevent and fade pigment spots. Natural smoothing agents provide an immediate tightening effect to your face. No phenoxyethanol, no silicone, no paraben.’<br /><br />I’m willing to give this serum a try, and this company I’ve not heard of, Phytema, a try.",A different approach to my skincare,2018-11-22 13:10:59.772

I follow this with micellar water (by Borghese) and then a serum and moisturizer.  The whole thing takes about 7 minutes (it's therapy, don't judge!).<br /><br />Upon waking, I swabbed my face with the micellar water and then took a picture of the cotton ball along with an untouched cotton ball for comparison.  And by the way for the uninitiated, micellar water is the best skincare product to come out since mascara was invented.  I was sure that my $349 Clarasonic erased all traces of dirt no matter the soap, but the micellar water never lies.<br /><br />On the second morning, first thing, I used the Clarasonic with the Radiance brush and three pumps of LaClaire Foaming Botanical Facial Cleanser.  Two pumps did not create a bit of lather.  Then using micellar water, I swabbed my face again and there you have the picture of both -- no cleanser and cleanser.<br /><br />You can see that there is still a lot of dirt left behind after using this cleanser, certainly less than no cleanser at all but there is still some there.

I've been using it for a couple weeks now and I can't say I've noticed a marked difference in my skin. Perhaps my skin was already wonderful. :)<br /><br />I will say for a supplement, this is one of the best tasting ones I've tried. I am always on the look out for new supplements and vitamins, etc. and I really like to try new things to promote skin quality, hair and nail growth, etc. Often the powders or pills or liquids are pretty tough to choke down. I tried a different collagen powder that made me gag so I was kind of worried about trying this.<br /><br />This is a liquid, but not too viscose. It's thicker than water but easily drinkable and quite tasty. It's a sweet orange flavor. The package says you can add it to smoothies, but I just drink it straight. It does need to stay refrigerated which could be annoying depending on the space available in your refrigerator.<br /><br />I would probably give it 4 stars for the taste, but the price is so high, and since I haven't noticed a difference I felt I had to knock one more star off. 99 dollars is a lot of money.","Tastes good, but I haven't noticed a difference in my skin",2018-05-23 09:27:53.179

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,B0B9C3C8SS,4,"This comes in an outer product box. It’s made in China. The tube this comes in is nice. It has a matte look to it.<br /><br />The contour stick was what really interested me in this set. So many cream contour sticks labeled as “contour” end up being really warm toned. Contour is supposed to mimic your natural shadows, so it’s supposed to be cool toned, even grey toned. But, it’s hard to find one that’s actually cool toned, and even harder finding one that’s grey toned. This one looked like it was neutral, leaning cool with a kind of rosy undertone. So, I wanted to give it a try. The few rosy/pink toned contour/bronzer sticks I’ve found have worked well for me as bronzers because I have neutral leaning slightly cool skin.<br /><br />On me, thus leans more warm toned than I’d like. But, once blended out, it isn’t as orange as others. Of course, it could be different for you, depending on your undertone. While it doesn’t work as a contour for me like it wanted, it does make a nice bronzer for me. The formula of it is nice. It’s soft, smooth, creamy. It blends easily. I never swipe sticks like these onto my face. I always take my sponge or brush, dab it onto the stick, and then blend it onto my skin. I find that works better and I don’t need to worry about whether swiping it directly on will lift my foundation underneath. This is pigmented, but it blends out so easily that it’s easy to blend it away. I find if I pick up and apply a little, it blends out easily and looks natural on my skin but I just need to be careful not to blend it away! But, I can also build it up for a more intense color. I like that. Once blended out, it is matte and dries down to a powder like finish that I don’t need to set and it lasts all day without any issues.<br /><br />The highlighter is okay. It’s too glittery for my liking. I like more of a pearl look without glitter. But if you don’t mind micro glitter, you might like this. Its really subtle aside from the glitter so I just think there’s better options.<br /><br />Overall, I think it’s worth it for the contour/bronzer side. It works really well and is easy to work with (when dabbing your brush/sponge onto the stick and then applying it) and it sets down on its own with a matte powder like finish without needing to be set. I wouldn’t recommend the highlighter. It’s just really sheer other than glitter so I think there’s better options. But, if you like a sheer but glittery highlighter, then this could work for you. I give it 4 stars because I really like the bronzer, I just don’t like the highlighter.",Nice bronzer but don’t like the highlighter,2022-12-04 15:48:26.144

You get a boost from:<br /><br />Caffeine- Derived from green tea, which provides you with instant firming and lifting results<br />Retinol- allows the skin to resurface at a quicker pace, lessening the appearance of the cellulite/dimples<br />Cocoa Butter- softens and also helps keep the skin looking beautiful<br />Shea Butter- allows the “newer” skin to get a healthy amount of nutrients and moisture<br />Vitamin C- helps your skin hold more moisture and gives it a healthy glow (brightens)<br />Vitamin B5- helps to keep skin soft and healthy, but also provides a smoother look<br />All products at InstaNatural are made in the USA and never animal tested<br /><br />Application- The product works best when applied twice a day, just like a facial skincare regimen. You apply the cream to skin that is clean and dry. You simply pump out the amount needed and apply to your thighs, stomach, legs, and anywhere you wish to address! Use a healthy amount of motion to make sure the cream penetrates and the caffeine hits those targeted areas. I went with a deep massage and allowed the cream to fully dry before dressing.<br /><br />What to Expect- Cellulite is one of those attributes you hear everyone has but that does not make you love it, or much less accept it. While over-the-counter products will not fully remove the appearance of the skin, it certainly can diminish it. I’m all for zapping it any way I can and InstaNatural’s Cellulite cream does aid with this pesky little problem. Thank the healthy amount of Caffeine in the product because it not only minimizes the appearance but provides you with instant results. You get to see a difference on the first day but it does not stop there. The cream has a nice amount of moisturizers like Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter, which penetrate and soften the appearance of the cellulite and surrounding skin. Then comes the Retinol punch that helps in not only repairing but rejuvenation, and by this I mean, it helps the “turn-over” process of shedding our “damaged” looking skin quicker.  The Retinol helps produce a less marked skin in less time than if not used! The cellulite/dimple mark will still be present but with continual use, you can achieve a minimizing look and the finer lines will be less visible, along with the dimples. I found the cream to not only help moisturize and produce softer and a more supple skin’s surface, but it also produced a more firmer appearance that was visible to the eye and touch. I am all for the instant results and especially as the days get warmer and the bikini is due to come out!<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.

AGLGX7DGPF5AUXRUA3OPADMXGPRA,B089RZ67T7,3,"Back in the golden oldie days B.C. (Before COVID-19), I wouldn’t have known the difference between a barber’s cape and a bullfighter’s cape. But today, home hair cutting is now the norm, and a barber’s cape is practically a necessity.<br /><br />This SmoTecQ one does the job with little drama. Measuring an adult-sized 57 by 63 inches, it has an elasticized neckband with two thin but sturdy metal clasps that can adjust to fit tightly around any size neck. The fabric in the back tended to gape open a little when I tested it, and it’s much shorter in the back than in the front, but overall it does a good job at what it’s intended to do. Hair doesn’t stick to it too badly, so it’s relatively easy to wipe clean after use. Folding it up to try to put it neatly back into its plastic storage bag was a challenge.<br /><br />That’s not to say that hair still doesn’t go all over the floor, though, and that’s why my amateur haircuts, whether I’m getting them or giving them, take place on one of my outdoor patios.<br /><br />Based on my zero knowledge of what makes a good one or a bad one, I have to rate this barber’s cape at a middle-of-the-road three stars. I wish I didn’t need one at all, but in the current reality, it’s a must-have item, and this one seems to do the job.",A Necessity for Home Hair Cutting,2020-07-12 17:20:52.818

I usually like it combed to the side, and pushed back, but with volume to give it a nice swoop. My hair is fine, but a lot of it.<br /><br />I’ve never been a fan of pomade in the past because I find it doesn’t hold it’s shape and is too shiny. However, this pomade provides a natural looking shine, while holding my hair in my preferred style. The pomade itself is very light and thin. I didn’t think it would work when applying, but within seconds it began to form my hair into my go-to style. It dries to a “tacky” feel, which allows you to readjust throughout the day, but wouldn’t feel comfortable to run your fingers through it. After applying, the product easily washed off my hands, and out of my hair at the end of the day.<br /><br />The scent is good but not overwhelming.

I didn't think it really added that much volume to my lashes as much as it actually lengthened them which is fine. It added a good amount of length to be honest and did add a little bit of volume though. I do believe you can build this up to more thickness but then you would get that spidery look that I do not care for.<br /><br />The wand is a nice thin wand that helps not making a mess all over. The bristles are shorter and make it very easy to use. The mascara is smudge proof. I had it on for a solid 16 hours and it did not budge until I used a makeup remover and it came off very easy at that point.<br /><br />This is a nice mascara and it will cost you $18.

Only 9 ingredients. It is so good. Truly comforting and non-irritating. Even when my skin is already in an irritated state.<br /><br />This is a beautifully thick, rich, white moisturizing cream. Yet, somehow it feels decently lightweight and comfortable on the face and neck. Not lightweight like a gel cream, by any means. But comfortable. This cream glides onto the face and neck smoothly, and it soaks into the skin quickly; But it doesn't disappear. It leaves a lasting, soothing, comforting layer of moisture and hydration on the surface of the skin. It helps to lock-in the moisture and hydration from the previous steps in my skincare routine, and leave my skin feeling so lovely and comfortable.<br /><br />The scent is extremely slight. It is herbal, but it's almost undetectable, unless you're really seeking after the scent.<br /><br />The packaging is a beautiful yellow glass jar with a beige twist-off lid. It feels very nice in the hand, and the cream feels luxurious on the face. Much more expensive than it is. The 80ml size is excellent for the price.<br /><br />The addition of gentle, anti-aging Bakuchiol is also a big win with zero irritation. Plus, Shea Butter for maximum moisture. I layer gentle, hydrating, soothing, calming toners and serums underneath this cream, and I get excellent glowy, dewy results.<br /><br />I use this cream day and night, as I have dry, sensitive skin. I imagine many skin types might like this for day or night, especially during colder months.<br /><br />If you have sensitive skin, and you cannot use most skincare products (like me), this is likely going to be for you.<br /><br />Overall, I'm highly impressed. Why did it take me so long to find this? This cream is so beautifully simple. It's truly an amazing find for someone like me, who struggles with sensitive skin. I will definitely repurchase, and I'm looking forward to trying more simple, gentle products from Tinazana.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cream to anyone and everyone.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polysilicone-34, Isononyl Isononanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ethyhexylglycerin, Bakuchiol.","Beautiful, Gentle Cream - So Simple & So Nice - Great For Dry Skin & Sensitive Skin",2022-11-05 18:42:54.664

AEPS33MI7LANKDAHRYF2MRKNYTIQ,B07CCZH87X,4,"At first, I was excited to get this micro-needling device, but then I started to look into micro needling. Dermatologists said to take Vitamin C 2 for weeks before use, and avoid sunlight; avoid makeup; your skin may peel afterward. So, I was afraid to try it out.  It turns out, that using this is not painful at all.  But when used on my forehead, it looks like it has more pores.  So, I decided to start taking vitamins, and planned out when to try this out, but I avoided trying it out before times when I planned to expose it to sunlight, along with one week before my (wife’s) period.<br /><br />Finally, I had the right time to try it out, and it had no obvious side effects...no pain, no skin flushing, no damage, no problems with sunlight or wearing makeup.  Because this is a device made for home use, it is much more mild than professional devices.  You may be able to use this every other day.<br /><br />The device is light weight, and rechargeable, but comes with batteries, so you don’t have to charge before use; this makes it easy to bring on travel.  I wish I had tried it much earlier.<br /><br />The head is supposed to be replaced every three months at a current cost of $35.  You are supposed to use a new cleaning pad before every use, and it came with 5 pads; the replacement skin prep pads are $35 for 30 pads which will last you two months, using it two to three times a week, which is what the manufacturer recommends.  The minimum monthly cost of supplies is about $38 per month.  You also need to have isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol to use with the provided spray bottle to sanitize the micro-needling head.<br /><br />I would recommend using sun screen after use, to protect your skin.<br /><br />After the first few uses, I haven’t seen much effect, but my husband thinks my face’s skin looks better.","Don’t Be Afraid, Just Give it a Try!",2019-10-06 01:13:31.905

Some kits try to force a look, but this one was open to play with. Maybe not the best idea for a beginner kit- but I enjoyed that.<br /><br />First the good:<br />I like this type of lamp when I'm doing gel- it's easy together both my hands in to hold the nail down when I first start, then I usually pick up the light and rotate it to get a full cure. Yes I have to restart the lamp a few times, but this isn't an expensive lamp so I don't mind.<br /><br />I liked the little box they came in- sure it's cheep, but it was a nice tough to have (almost) everything in once place.<br /><br />Then the annoying:<br /><br />There are a lot of odd little problems, like the Gel itself, two are jelly clear and one is opaque. Opaque gel takes a little longer to cure because the light works a bit harder to travel though the nail. It would have been helpful if they mentioned that, OR only gave you one type of gel-so it doesn't confuse you-- but they didn't.<br /><br />The nail forms were a bad fir for my hand. Thats just an unlucky break- all hands are diffrent- so im not including that in my rating, just something to mention in case they don't work for you too.<br /><br />The colors were a little annoying to use, no color indicator on the bottle. this is common with cheeper sets, but I thought I'd mention it anyway- It can make doing your nails just a little bothersome.<br /><br />The ugly-<br />they don't include slip solution-I ended up using my own from my nail kit, so I didn't have any problems, but that's a huge mistake on their part-- if you're just starting out you'll think gel nails are a sticky mess. Slip solution makes them manageable.<br /><br />Overall- I feel like there are better kits that will give you a cleaner start over this one--<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful!",I wouldn't start with this--,2020-08-12 04:55:43.749

AFKX24ALWAPX366KX6DWTOBWLQAA,B088FBNQXW,2,"What's that saying about necessity being the mother of invention? Well here we are in a pandemic wearing face masks. Someone came up with the idea of a head band with buttons to hold the mask mask in place.<br /><br />This is a thin material. Think very thin t shirt type material. The headband measures about 18 inches and just over 3 inches wide. I like the material for a headband. However, its use as a mask holder is iffy. Many people complain that the elastic that holds the masks in place makes their ears pop out. That is definitely true of some masks. They can also be wearying on the ears, having that elastic against your ears all day, so this headband is a great concept.<br />I put the headband on and as I stretched it over my head, I heard a pop, so some stitching gave somewhere.<br /><br />I attached two types of masks, one at a time. First, it was a bit fiddly to get the elastic over the button. Once it just sprang off.<br /><br />One mask using the buttons fit well. Another did not. The latter mask opened up on the sides.<br /><br />I would hesitate to wear this out thinking that everything would stay put for hours. I like the headband as a headband. It's nice material.

AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,B08BB3P4VQ,5,"La La Leaf Guayaquil Hemp Lotion feels cooling and calming to my dry, sensitive skin. It feels light, absorbs quickly and moisturizes my skin fairly well. This lotion leaves my hands and skin soft, silky and comfortable. I don’t feel my dry skin gets as much hydration as I get with my favorite premium body butters and creams, but those are heavier products so I don’t expect as much from a lotion.<br /><br />When applied after my shower, I get about 8 hours of hydration. That’s pretty good, though not the 24 hours claimed on the site. I do have dry skin and find this lotion hydrates better than most lotions. I’ve occasionally found one that gives me longer lasting hydration, but it’s uncommon. Excipial keeps my dry skin comfortable and itch free more like 12 hours but has chemicals such as parabens, while Guayaquil Hemp Lotion emphasizes organic and natural ingredients (but does have Phenoxyethanol).<br /><br />Guayaquil Hemp Lotion feels gentle and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin at all. It doesn’t list chemical fragrance and is labeled fragrance free, which is a big plus as some fragrances trigger sensitivities for me. But it still may have fragrance. I smell a faint non offensive scent and don’t know if it’s from added “essential oil” (last ingredient) or just the natural scent of the natural ingredients.<br /><br />Guayaquil Hemp Lotion has 250 mg of CBD (THC free), which is still being studied but “may” hydrate dry skin and help inflammation. The ingredients look good but this lotion does have moderately risky (per EWG) Phenoxyethanol in the top ten ingredients and drying alcohol in the bottom 5.

It is not cheap at almost $100 to be honest. When you use this you will need about a drop for each side of your face, so a little does go a long way, but this is still not an inexpensive product so handle this as such.<br /><br />This particular one is filled with pomegranate oil, cacao oil infused with white peony root, marigold flower and lotus leaf. This particular blend is supposed to be brightening, soothing, regenerating, purifying and reduce the appearance of dullness. When you use this you will notice this oil definitely has a fragrance to it that is reminiscent of an essential oil. They recommend to use it morning and night, however in my experience when you use this it does absorb fairly quickly. It does leave an oily residue on your skin though. If you wear makeup and especially right now with wearing masks, I would not recommend applying this facial oil in the morning. For a makeup application that could cause trouble and I found with facial oils I sweat heavily when wearing masks.<br /><br />It provided some moisture but I didn’t really see a brightening effect to be honest, however I did feel that my skin felt oily which is why I prefer using this in the evening. In the morning my skin felt nicely moisturized. Is this really worth the price?

It didn't take me long to realize that I really, really loved this face wash.<br /><br />It arrives in a relatively small 4-ounce bottle. The face wash includes 20% Vitamin C along with Organic Aloe Vera, MSM, and Organic Rose Hip Oil. It utilizes the actual lemon peel, a process that is noted to contain 5-10 times more vitamins than the lemon juice. The wash is designed to naturally exfoliate, remove blackheads, and naturally lighten the skin.<br /><br />While the 4-ounce bottle seems quite small, it takes very little to do the job. The wash comes out as a sort of milky lotion that lathers lightly yet effectively. The lemon peel contains citric and phytic acids and I felt that sort of acidic quality on my face, but it was lighter than a typical exfoliant. It left my skin cleaner, but in a healthy way rather than in a glowing way.<br /><br />This is designed to be a daily face wash. I'm not completely sure I'd use it on a daily basis given its price point, but I have to admit it feels so natural and has been so effective that I may be convinced otherwise by the time this first bottle is actually done. I love the way that it's making my face look and feel and I'm super pleased with the healthier appearance.<br /><br />For me, this has turned out to be rather gentle giant of a face wash.

With how often eyeshadow palettes come with broken shadows, I always appreciate when one comes with extra care taken to protect it! The palette has cardboard packaging. There’s an outer sleeve cover. It has the exact same look on the front and back on the outer sleeve cover as it does on the outer packaging of the palette. The shade names are found on the back of the palette and are also labeled under each shade inside the palette, which I like. A lot of affordable palettes, they don’t have the shade names inside, which is usually fine with me because it’s so affordable and they have to cut costs somewhere. So, when the shade names are included inside the palette on affordable palettes, I always appreciate it. There’s also a big mirror that is just a little smaller than the lid. Again, a lot of affordable palettes don’t have mirrors, which is another way to cut costs for the companies to make the palette a cheaper price. Again, not something I mind since it’s affordable. So, again, when I see mirrors in affordable palettes, I appreciate it. There’s also a removable plastic sheet cover over the shades inside the palette.<br /><br />The shades are all beautiful. (See photos of swatches).<br /><br />The mattes have good pigment, feel smooth, not chalky at all. Brushes pick them up well and they apply on the eyes nicely. A few shades need built up a little more, but not too much where I get annoyed 😂<br /><br />The shimmers/metallics are smooth, pigmented, and pretty shimmery. A brush picks them up easily, and they apply easily and look beautiful using fingers or brushes.<br /><br />There’s 2 pressed glitters. 1 of them isn’t small circular kind of glitters. It’s small stars. I don’t really love when pressed glitters are in a palette. I have a love hate relationship with glitter. Love the look of it, hate how it gets EVERYWHERE, you’re finding glitter particles everywhere for a while after you use it. Plus, they aren’t safe for the eyes. Get some in the eye and you can scratch your cornea! But, smaller glitter particles aren’t too bad in my opinion. However, with the one in this palette that has stars, those would be waaaaaay more risky than smaller circular like glitter particles. The stars are bigger and have extremely pointy edges. Plus, it’s hard to pick up with your finger. So, I really don’t like that pressed glitter. The other pressed glitter is made up of tiny particles. It picks up easily, sticks pretty good on its own, great with a wet base like concealer or glitter glue. So, I don’t like that 2 shades are pressed glitters, but the palette is so affordable, 2 I don’t like and probably won’t use out of the 18 isn’t so bad to me.<br /><br />There’s 1 shade that is a concealer shade. It’s a cream kind of concealer. I fear it would dry out, so I’ll be putting a piece of tape over it, with the edge bent over together to leave a little tab to pull it up if I want to use it (I did this with my Huda New Nude palette and the concealer shade hasn’t dried up). The shade is pretty thin and waxy feeling. I don’t feel I’ll ever really use it, but just in case figure I’d keep it from drying out.<br /><br />This is a dupe for Hudas New Nude palette (see swatch photos comparing the 2).<br />- They even have the shades named the exact same as the shades in Hudas palette, except one that is named “Spanked” in Huda is named “Spaked” in this palette and one that is named “Love Bite” in Huda is names “EITE” in this palette 🤦‍♀️ 😂 (see photos to see both palettes together).<br />- All of the shades and their placement in this palette correspond exactly to the shades and their placement in Hudas palette, except the shades “Spanked” and “Love Bite,” and “Concealed” and “Play.” In both palettes, “Spanked” and “Love Bite” are in the first row, the last 2. But, in this palette it’s, “Spaked” and “Love Bite” and in the Huda palette it’s “Love Bite” and “Spanked.” In the Huda palette, “Concealed” is the concealer shade and “Play” is a light peach matte shade. In this palette “Concealed” is a nude type shade, that has a little peachy color to it and “Play” is the concealer shade. So, in the Huda palette there’s a light peach matte shade called “Play” that this palette does not have (this palette has a nude with a slight peach tint to it).<br />- Other than that, the shades are pretty spot on. In the Huda palette, the metallics feel just a little creamier, but not by much. In this palette they feel really smooth, not chunky at all. As you can see in the swatches, the metallic shades aren’t quite as metallic as they are in the Huda palette, but they are pretty darn close. The colors of all the shades are also pretty darn close. I’d say the shade that’s most off, other than the light peach matte shade not being a full on peach shade and more of a nude shade with a peach tint in this palette, the other shade that’s the most off is “Kinky.” In the Huda palette it’s a deeper, richer red. In this palette it’s more of a burnt orange type red or rust kind of red. You can see in the swatches. Then, the “Concealed” shade in the Huda palette, the corresponding shade in this palette is “Play.” The Huda one is creamier, and has more color. As I said before, the one in this palette is thinner and waxy feeling. The pressed glitters - “Excite” is made of small, red glitter particles in both palettes. The Huda one is smoother feeling, not so rough feeling. “Infatuated” in this palette is totally different than Hudas, it’s silver and stars, not red with small glitter particles.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great palette. Good packaging, a nice mirror inside. The shades perform well. The mattes are smooth and blend easily and have good pigment. The metallic shades are smooth and pigmented and look beautiful. If you were looking for a nude/pink palette, this is a great choice! If you have been wanting the Huda palette but didn’t like the cost of it, this is a great choice instead. The colors are pretty spot on, the differences are slight where once they’re on the eye, it wouldn’t be too noticeable. Other than the star pressed glitter and the nude shade with some peach in it. This palette would definitely give you the same looks. I really do think it’d a great affordable palette!",Great Palette! Great Dupe!,2020-11-03 17:21:55.612

One pad is enough to remove makeup, eyes included. Once you are done, it leaves a slightly oily feeling which is absorbed pretty fast. I thought I wouldn't like that feeling since I am not a big fan of greasy feeling on my face. However, this is very light and helps moisturizing the skin.<br /><br />Regarding the ingredients, I am happy to see it does not contain any synthetic fragrance that is high hazard for the skin and it is a very common ingredient in skin care products. It also contains jojoba oil that is very moisturizing and Centella Asiatica (Cica) that soothes and brighten the skin. Not to mention Eggplant extract that has antioxidants.<br /><br />The only callout would be to include a way to keep the tweezers attached to the lid, this way you don't have to put them on top of the wipes or keep them outside the closed bottle that could possibly get lost.","Beautiful package, effective product!",2021-11-29 23:27:40.181

Very moist.<br />  - mask doesn't rip or tear<br />  - plastic backing for easier application<br />  - gentle, pleasant aroma<br />  - sinks quickly into skin after massaging at end<br /><br />Cons: - thin<br />  - hard to slide into place...and then doesn't fit quite right<br />  - suggested wear time is 20-25 mins....longer than usual<br /><br />These masks come individually packaged in robust and easy to open pouches. The mask has a sturdy, plastic backing, which is the only reason it can be unfolded and placed on without any trouble because these are thin. Surprisingly, they don't rip or tear easily, though. After taking off the backing, it takes a little maneuvering to get these to sit in place. Firstly, the thin material wanted to bunch and roll along the edges of the face, and the lack of thickness made it difficult to get to lay flat. Also, the eye holes aren't quite right. I, my son, and my daughter tried them (each with very different face sizes) and all of us had trouble with the eyes. When they were in position, The bridge of the nose wouldn't stay pressed against the skin, but kept lifting up. The suggested wear time is 20 to 25 minutes, which is longer than the 15 to 20 I normally see on masks. Removing the mask, however, is no problem, and there's a good amount of moisture left over to massage into the skin....which also works well<br /><br />The masks are moistening and have a gentle, pleasant odor (although I can't really place it). These are refreshing and leave the skin shiny. If only they'd sit better, I'd enjoy them more.",Moistens,2020-10-30 14:08:55.059

Running my own eco family farm full time helps considerably ;)<br /><br />I like everything about these bottles except for the same exact thing I don't like about my other set of bottles, the spray head rotates easily. It doesn't unscrew, that's not what I'm talking about. It's the spray head itself. I think if the bottle wasn't so heavy this wouldn't be an issue, but when spraying downward, the bottle will move due to the weight. If I hold the bottle with one hand, while spraying with the other, all is well.<br /><br />A possible solution to this might be to purchase these 16 oz amber glass bottles separately, then purchase a separate pack of very highly rated, top quality spray nozzles & a sheet of labels to see if that helps. Perhaps these sets are being sold with lower quality spray nozzles. I really cannot say.

Then comb with wide tooth comb from the scalp upward to the ends and let it stay in for 5 minutes ( this is a negative to me ...5 minutes waiting is too long). Finally rinse thoroughly and style. It is infused with tea tree oil and Chia seed oil. My husband agreed with my thoughts on amount of product and time. He thought it was just okay, nothing fantastic.

Usually when my hands get bad (even just one hand) I have to apply a cortisone rub a few times a day over a few days to make the redness, flakiness, and itchiness subside.<br /><br />I was hesitant to get this because the ingredients seem pretty simple for something that is supposed to make a difference in psoriasis.  Well I am surprised at how effective this spray is.  Instead of touching the cortisone rub at all - I just sprayed this on the backs of my hands.  Granted I was working form home for the entire day - so I pretty much sprayed it a bunch of times over the course of the day.  The redness got MUCH better.  And the flakiness totally went away.  The only thing is my skin on the bad hand looked a bit dry - but I guess that is because this is a spray and not an emollient cream or anything.  To the touch, my hand felt pretty soft with only the slightest dry patches felt.  Anytime I can avoid cortisone (steroids) I consider a really good time.<br /><br />I am happy with this spray and have a feeling I will always have to keep some on hand going forward.

I’m not a fan of the “natural look” makeup, i like a bold eye, and you can have that with this palette. I particularly love the Red, Dark Blue, Gray and Black shades. And if you find that you want the red to look darker, you can add a bit of black into the crease, and deepen it. I always want palettes to have a black pan - it’s useful for other things like lining, and smoking out.<br /><br /> If you choose to use an eyeshadow primer (or even just a concealer or foundation) then the colour payoff is more intense. If you don’t wear a primer, you might need to add more on top. I always wear a primer, because it makes sure the eyeshadow stays on longer, and prevents it settling into my crease.<br /><br />Essence have some very good products, i first bought their products way back in 2007, in a bricks and mortar store, and they were so affordable, and such good quality.

Now, the sessions will be only once a month until all the unwated hair is removed. The manufacturer recommends using it once every 2 weeks for the first 5 sessions and then once a month after that, so using it multiple times a week won't change the outcome. The areas I use this device are my legs, under arms, bikini area and upper lip. The only difference I've noticed so far is the upper lip hair. It is growing significantly less, like almost 90% is gone. The rest of the body hair still grows the same amount, but the hair started to grow softer. I assume the hair is finally becoming weaker. I am half Greek and half Italian, I have olive skin color with dark hair, so it might take over a year for me to see some results. Overall, the device is very easy to use and it is painless, but it gets super hot to the touch after about 5-10 minutes of continues usage. I use the device on my legs first and then take a break until it cools down, and then I continue using it on other parts of the body and stop to cool it down again.

AGV5NQ4JDQD6NHXVF6AVZPVDX66Q,B07FP2C8N8,5,"I know this is a baby bath oil, but I'm a fan of using bath oils as shave oils.  A little goes a long way, just a few drops per leg (or you can add a drop to your regular shave gel). Helps reduce irritation and you can see where you are shaving! I can't live without it. It's better than any foam, gel or lotion on the market. Truly the best shave experience. I have thick hair and dry flaky skin that is prone to itching and sensitivity. I use this bath oil with a cheapie disposable razor and a few drops of body oil after a shower and my legs are silky for days. Literally days. No razor burn, no irritation, no frustration. I prefer unscented products and this is truly unscented--thank you! Please use caution when using oils in the tub, but I haven't had any problems with the tub getting slippery. Only thing I would change in a better bottle with a pump or dropper top. It's easy to use too much. A little goes a long way so if you're hesitant about the price, don't be, because you'll end up spending more in the long run on something cheaper.<br /><br />Also, used this as a body wash after getting a little too much sun today, and my skin was super soothed.  I think it will help prevent my skin from developing a sunburn--bonus!

While I don't use face masks every day, it has taken me a while to use just a few of them, and specific masks, like the hydration mask, aren't best suited for my face type. Out of the whole set, my favorite masks have been the brightening and antioxidant masks. While I was slightly hesitant to use the antioxidant mask at first due to my oily combo skin, it left me with no clogged pores or irritation, and it brightened and soothed my skin.<br /><br />As I mentioned initially, I don't use face masks too often, and the masks I usually use are pretty cheap. Trying these masks has ruined me a little because it will be hard to go back to my regular masks. The one thing I don't like about these masks is the price. I think $42 is a little bit much for seven face masks, but it depends on how often you use face masks and how much of a splurge you want them to be. in terms of quality, I think the Karuna masks are great.",High Quality Masks that Don't Irritate the Skin,2021-02-27 18:53:54.470

The carabiner is small, but it's strong enough to keep the bottle where it needs to be as long as there isn't serious weight constantly pulling on it. So far, so good.<br /><br />The thing I worry about most with a little bottle like this is what happens if you put a lot of pressure on it (sit on it, lean against the wall when it's in a pocket or on a belt loop, etc). I was concerned that the flip top would pop open and I'd end up with hand sanitizer all over the place, but I tested these little guys full of liquid before filling with sanitizer. The pliability of the silicone doesn't allow a burst of pressure to push off the flip top-- not even close. Plus, the top screws tightly into place.

AGQ5ERLI2VUZVYLQV5WYJ5TLGVYA,B000UK2VRK,4,"This is another excellent shaving product from Philips -- it cuts like an ordinary shaver, but with the added benefit of lubrication that helps it to shave smoothly.  My skin doesn't get irritated or dry, and the lubrication seems to help the shave to go more quickly.  I've tried other brands of shavers and this one seems to work the best.<br /><br />This package comes with a squeeze bottle full of a very pleasant smelling lotion, that you inject into the back of the shaver.  Then, when you are shaving, you just press a button and it releases enough lotion to lubricate about one third of the face.  When it starts to feel like a dry shave, you press the button again and finish up.<br /><br />I have found that the amount of lotion you can inject into the shaver is enough for about 5 to 6 shaves.  The shaver comes with a small sample bottle of the lotion -- and I guess one drawback is that you have to keep buying the lotion, unless you want to use this like an ordinary dry shaver.  I've tried that too and it seems to work as well as any other shaver I've tried.  I prefer, though, to use the lotion.  It feels good and has a nice aftershave smell that my wife also likes -- that's good enough for me.<br /><br />Because the system is water resistant, you can shave in the shower, and you can wash it off in water when you are finished.  The extendable trimmer isn't very useful, but I've never seen a shaver where they are.

With regards to masks, I've tried some that have worked well, some that caused my skin to burn and some that caused my already dry skin to become even drier.

I would have been crushed if I had experienced a negative reaction because this really is one heck of a clay mask!<br /><br />Huxley is a nice, gentle mask. But don't let that fool you, it may be gentle but it does a heck of an exceptional job!  It applies nice and easy.  I let it sit on my skin for 10 minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water, right before its nearly dry.  It exfoliates well leaving my skin soft, smooth , a bit brighter and healthy. Dead skin cells are washed away.  My skin literally feels GOOD after using Huxley.  This mask does have a light scent but it doesn't last long. It is recommended Huxley be used 1-3 times a week. I use it twice a week though I could probably get away with using it only a week because the results Huxley delivers are long lasting.<br /><br />I'm so relieved I will be able to continue to use this mask on my skin.

AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,B09X23VTSQ,3,"I have dry, sensitive and mature (55+) skin and used this Reboncel Aqua Rich Foaming Cleanser daily for about a week. This cleanser has fragrance that smells relatively light to me, though fragrance is an ingredient that poses health risks. I generally avoid foaming face cleansers as they tend to make my skin overly dry, but this has a pleasing creaminess and initially made my skin feel good. It cleaned my skin well yet left it feeling refreshed, soft and comfortable after use.<br /><br />After using this wash more than a few days in a row, it felt more clarifying (better for oily skin) than hydrating to my skin. While it didn’t strip my skin or make it visibly irritated, by the end of the week my skin just didn’t feel as comfortable as it did at first and it felt like my skin would end up too dry if I continued daily use. So I switched back to my creamy, hydrating cleansers, but felt this cleanser would still be good to use as needed as a clarifying cleanser.<br /><br />However, while this wash has some good ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Aloe Extract and Sodium Hyaluronate, this has controversial Triethanolamine (“TEA”) high on the ingredient list. It’s on my personal list of ingredients to avoid after reading many articles about it and seeing it on lists of risky chemical by many sources. Some sources say it’s safe in amounts we get thru cosmetics, but I’m concerned about the cumulative effect of risky chemicals.<br /><br />TEA is a nitrosamine used to generate foam and adjust pH and is likely a hormone disrupter and irritant. But the bigger issue for me is that TEA gets absorbed through the skin and reacts with other chemicals to form the carcinogen NDEA. While less risky in rinse off products, it still poses more risk than I’m comfortable with. The problem is that I have no way to know if this cleanser or any product I’m using with it has chemicals that react with TEA.<br /><br />So, for me, I find it best to avoid all products with TEA, especially since so many alternative products are available that don’t have it. I also dislike that this has so much Cocamidopropyl Betaine (second ingredient), which I generally avoid mostly due contamination concerns. Fragrance also poses health risks, though it’s a common ingredient I don’t avoid altogether (but I do try and minimize use).

The masks are folded in such a way that they're compressed to the size of 2 nickels stacked on top of each other. To use you simply pour lotion or facial cream onto it and then slowly and carefully unfurl it on your face. The first time around you'll likely waste a few masks as the paper is very thin and if you're not careful they tear quite easily.

Although after I applied it into my hair, it wasn't that bad.<br />I have incorporated a few times now into my regular routine (shampoo, conditioner, leave-in, curl cream and gel) and it has worked well so far. Hair feels soft and define. The way I applied it was on damp hair, making sure product was evenly distributed.<br />One thing to consider when using it, is not to apply too much product on your hair, I used about 2 dime size on all my hair. For thin hair I would recommend half of it, otherwise hair will look very greasy.<br />Lastly, ingredients are very good for your hair. I have been following the Curly Girl Method (CGM) for about 6 months and one of the major recommendations is to avoid parabens, silicones, sulfates, non-water soluble waxes and drying alcohols, and all ingredients in this leave-in are safe to use if you are following the CGM as well.","Different container, soft hair, CGM approved",2020-12-29 18:17:52.247

AHBFC446AIQBMLC3U4SV6YJJERPQ,B08CZ5JZMZ,4,"Since I recently requested and started using a Gel Polish kit, I found myself in need of some gel polish remover tools, so I requested this product from Vine. This review is for: Nail Polish Gel Remover Tools Kit for Women with Nail Clip Caps, Nail File, Nail Remover Cotton Pads,Brush, 2-in-one Cuticle Scraper/Pusher.<br /><br />First things first, I was surprised to come here to write this review and discover that I received no dispenser bottle as listed and pictured in the product description. Since this kit does NOT come with the remover liquid,  you are going to have to buy some acetone. (In my state, you must be 21 to buy it.) Since this came with no bottle, I followed the directions on the acetone itself, and used a glass measuring cup in which to pour it. (This way if I didn't use it all, I could easily pour it back into the bottle. Note to self, buy another measuring cup!)<br /><br />With that out of the way, this kit worked as described. I used tweezers and soaked the little pads in acetone and then wrapped it around my nail and applied the clamp. I did this to all of my nails at once, because my husband was here to help me with the second hand. If you have no one to help you, then you're going to need to do each hand separately. It is impossible to do much with these clamps on your fingernails. Once the clamps are on, you need to wait at least 20 minutes before removing them, to soften up the polish.<br /><br />Once I removed the clamps I set to work scraping off the polish. It does NOT come right up like regular polish does, but if you've soaked them for 20 minutes, and you applied it in thin layers when you originally polished them, it's easy to scrape the rest of it off. Once you're done, your nails look pretty bad. It will be necessary to buff them out and then wash them and apply some moisturizing lotion because your nails and the tips of your fingers will be very, very dry.<br /><br />I have heard some real horror stories of people trying to get gel nails and gel nail polish off, but this kit made it much easier and alleviated my fears. Other than the missing dispenser bottle, I'm rather happy with this kit.","Good Kit, But No Bottle and You Will Need Acetone",2021-04-12 13:46:35.055

It felt odd at first as I've only ever used bottled products, but quickly got used to it and could definitely see myself using more bars in the future.  I tried both running the conditioner bar down my hair and lathering it up a little in my hand and applying that way.  Between the two, I felt that I got pretty good coverage and results.  My hair felt less tangled and I was able to work a brush through pretty easily once I got out the shower.  When my hair dried, it seemed softer and healthier looking than it had previously, and my curls had a little more life to them.<br /><br />I only have two concerns - the first is that I'm struggling to find a place to put the bars in my shower where they won't get misted by water and disintegrate more quickly that way.  The second is the smell.  Although it's not unpleasant, it reminded me a little of a scented candle, and was very strong.  Three different people commented on the smell of my hair that week, which is not something that usually happens to me.  My husband thought that I smelled like cologne!  I could see this being a pro or a con depending on how you feel about fragrances.  Personally, I found it overwhelming as I'm more on the sensitive side to smells.<br /><br />Overall, I would consider trying this or a similar product again in the future, but only with a less intense scent.",Strong fragrance,2022-01-10 16:17:49.932

Directions said to put booties on feet. I wasnt sure if i should take them out of the plastic, so i didnt because there was alot of liquid in them. The packets also said to not use if you are breastfeeding or pregnant so that was concerning - not sure what is in it or how it effects milk, but i still pump for my daughter. I kept these securely on my feet for the directed amount of time and then took them off and took a shower. A couple days later my right foot started to peel first but got really itchy so i think i scratched off some of the peeling skin. The description says it will peel in about a week and leave skin smooth but my whole foot didnt peel and I still have patches of dried skin and calluses.

The pads are dry, some sort of resealable envelope would have worked just fine. I'd even be appeased if there were a refill package available.

I can't put my finger on what it was exactly just that I didn't really like it, but I can be picky over scents so that might just be me.

I think it’s a good assortment of colors.<br /><br />They don’t seem to have much hair in each extension. They seem kind of thin.

I like that they’re longer, so I could trim them to fit my length.<br /><br />They don’t come with any kind of care instructions.

It is pretty small and portable, and the use of a USB connection makes it more versatile. Also something to note if you are interested is the fact that this grinder does not make too much noise.<br /><br />Now to talk a little about what the product could improve on, the inclusion of a wall plug would have been nice. I imagine most people have some sort of access to a USB plug but if you do not, you are going to need to buy one. One other issue to point out is that the length of the cord could ideally be a little longer. You can use an extension to mitigate this problem or just sit near a USB connection.<br /><br />Overall this product does what it advertises. If you are trying to look for something that will help you save time this will help you do that. I cannot speak about the long term durability of this product, but what I can say is that I have been using it for a couple of weeks and have not ran into any issues.

Both of the cheaper options were incredibly painful and flimsy feeling. One of them even felt kind of like getting a face tattoo. It was awful. The GloPRO option actually feels nice on the skin because of the vibration feature and the red light therapy is a huge benefit for those monthly breakouts. I do feel like my skin care is absorbing more effectively since I've been using this, but it's still an extremely expensive tool.

The scents are wonderful and relaxing, reminiscent of walking through a forest or field and breathing in ""nature"".  The candles are made of 100% Soy wax (the best) and scented with natural Essential Oils of Lavender and Balsam Fir.  What's nice about these is the subtleness of the fragrances, but yet, still very aromatic - no sweet flowery smell, just nature!  The candles come in very substantial round metal tins and lids, about 2 1/4"" high, and 3"" across.  Each candle has 2 wicks sticking up out of the creamy white wax.  These together or separate would make a nice gift for anyone that would enjoy an alternative to a floral aromatherapy.....a very nice and different, calming experience.",Two excellent scents worth trying - back to nature.,2021-03-04 23:18:27.405
AFBLBHZPHEI3LN5WKJGOUACDPJXQ,B07K153R2B,5,"I am loving this combo curling iron. I have used other curling/straightening irons in the past but most are barely adequate for either task. But this one is intelligently designed and excels at both. Switching between curling and straightening is easy - there is a ""C"" button on one side of the handle and an ""S"" button on the opposite side to engage each task. The curling clasp holds my long hair securely as does the straightening iron. Two features that are great are the long swivel cord and the fact that this is dual voltage - that is a feature that is getting harder to find on hair appliances. I travel a lot and like that I only need to bring one hair tool with me, whether in the US or abroad. Even at home it is great to not have to heat up two different tools if I need to curl parts of my hair and straighten others. And the price is really affordable for something of this quality and with so many features. Certainly the best I have used for either straightening or curling that I can remember. This also includes a travel case which is a nice bonus.","Excellent dual purpose, dual voltage hair appliance",2019-01-23 21:23:12.794

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,B08JPJ4Z7V,4,"These come in a cute little red product box sealed with plastic wrapping. The back has a sticker on the plastic wrapping that has the ingredients listed (see photos). The box has “To be a sexy lady surprise yourself” on the front along with a red heart sticker that seals the lid and says “Surpise!” Then, under that it says “She Loves” and below that says “True Love Classic Velvet Lip Gloss.” It’s really cute outer packaging. Once you remove the outer plastic wrapping, the back of the box just has a bunch of Chinese writing (see photos), so I like they at least put that sticker on the back on the outside of the plastic wrapping.<br /><br />The tubes are really small, but cute. They are a kind of matte white with “SHE LOVES” written in silver holographic letters going all around the top. The caps are matte and the color of shade of lipstick, and the bottom of each tube has a sticker that’s the color of the shade of lipstick and the number for the shade. The caps twist off and there’s a doe foot applicator. For some reason when I first went to open one, I pulled on the cap. It came right off, revealing a black cap (see photos). Luckily the cap cover went right back on and stayed on without issues. But, kind of weird it comes off like that. Like it’s not glued on or something? So, of course, I then had to see if they all pulled off like that....they did (see photos). 2 of them I thought weren’t going to come off (I was just pulling lightly, I didn’t want to force them off), but then they came off too. But, again, I’m just glad they went back on and stayed on without issue.<br /><br />The tubes are small, so the doe foot applicators are small (see photos). The doe foot applicators are thin, longer rectangle shape, flat on each side. I liked them. They were small, but still easy enough to handle.<br /><br />The colors are all extremely pigmented. They are all nice and smooth. They go on evenly. They don’t take long to dry. They last a good amount of time.<br /><br />The only downside I see is the tubes are white, so they can get dirty easy. If you have them in your purse or makeup drawer, they will probably end up getting dirty. Also, the caps coming off like they do, like they aren’t glued on good.

She thinks that this isn't a great value, but is a fair value.<br /><br />They come in a box with a built-in tweezer and tweezer holder.  The tweezers are used to remove the masks without touching them.  The box is made of a heavy plastic, so it doesn't seem to be more ecologically responsible than selling wipes in individual packs.","Moisturizes Well, Doesn't Seem to Unclog Pores or Exfoliate Well",2021-12-20 01:44:14.169

First off, it is literally dry, not in an aerosol type of container.  You screw open the top (like and elmers glue bottle) and shake onto your head. Well. The little safety piece of cardboard was not attached to the bottle but stuck in the lid.  I did not know this until I tried to use it to no avail. And when you open the bottle be prepared for stuff to fly out. When I did get to the point I could use it, it turned out to be so light colored and obvious on my head I had to work it well into my hair, brush and shake my head so it was not such a glaring product. I will admit it did a great job in ""thickening"" my very fine hair, but it really needs to come in colors; blonde, brunette, etc. so it is not so obvious.  Will I buy it again?

It is also nice for cleaning off his paws after he has stepped in something that has gotten them dirty.<br />Overall, I bought these to help me with one purpose - taking care of my pup’s weepy eyes, but wound up finding them useful in a number of cases.

AH5OTJDIHBG4SYLRYWKS7MR7NWUQ,B07RD8KL9D,3,"(A thought: If you think of this as more of a body mist instead of a face mist, you may be happier with it. The strong perfumed scent is a little much to take sprayed directly on the face. However, when after toweling off from a shower, I sprayed this over my body, and even a little on my damp hair before blow-drying, with just a tiny spritz around my face, and it did much better—I smelled good and it’s not as strong as a regular perfume would be.)<br /><br />I love facial mists. They soothe and calm my skin, and refresh my face, and my mood. I want to give this 4 stars because it seems to be a nice mist, but there are unknowns. I’m giving it 3 stars based on how I like the feel of it, and the scent, though strong, is nice but a bit much to spray in my face—<br /><br />This Valjean face mist in Glow comes in a really nice heavy glass bottle—I like glass bottles because I can reuse them, or I can check to make sure they can be recycled, which is important to me. But reusing them by making my own face mist is nice—would be great if Valjean offered refillable options so once this bottle is emptied, I can put in more of the same product.<br /><br />This mist feels amazingly refreshing. You’ll need to note that it has a pretty strong scent. And the scent is kind of a perfume scent; that was a surprise to me. I wasn’t sure I liked that at first, and still I have to be careful when I spritz it.<br /><br />However, I like this scent. And though it can seem to be strong when I first spray it, it doesn’t overpower me or linger too long. If you spray it and it lands on your clothes, the scent will linger longer but it’s soft and I like the tones of the scent. But, again, on the face I have to be very careful.<br /><br />There isn’t a lot of information about the company or the product on this Amazon page, which is puzzling, for I’d like to know a bit more about the product I’m putting on my face. I googled the company and couldn’t find much there either. Except for a dermatology site that indicated the same thing I did: why doesn’t this company list more about their products.<br /><br />Am I just spritzing perfumed water on my face with a few minerals added? How much? What’s the perfume scent? They don’t even tell me what the scent is. However, on the back of the bottle is the list of ingredients and I suppose that helps. But I’d like more on this Amazon page, or that I can google.<br /><br />To that end, I’ll continue to use the facial mist for times I need a boost in mood or I’m sweaty after a workout or it’s hot in the summer.",Works better as a body mist because of the strong scent.,2020-02-07 14:03:14.114
AGLGX7DGPF5AUXRUA3OPADMXGPRA,B0932Z1NM1,1,"Most of the products that I receive through the Amazon Vine program are decent to excellent, but I sometimes get really bad ones. I never let the fact that I receive the products free affect my ratings. I always call the shots as I see them. This SUPRENT razor is the latest example; its stunning manifestation of idiotic product design catapulted it in one fell swoop to the top of my ignominious list of “Worst Products E-V-E-R!”<br /><br />It’s so bad that I shan’t waste time enumerating its faults in detail, or in trying to be humorous or clever as I usually do in my reviews. This stinker doesn’t even warrant the effort it takes to make a bulletized list, but herewith I reluctantly give it that much attention:<br /><br />- It’s too heavy to maneuver around the face or wherever.<br />- The head is too big for precise shaving in tight areas such as under the nose.<br />- The “38.5° Golden Shaving Angle” is the wrong angle for just about every surface.<br />- The worst of its many bone-headed “features” is that the chrome-plated zinc handle is too thin for a firm grip; it slips, slides and spins with Teflon-like frictionlessness in the hand, which is not only annoying but actually dangerous. How could it not occur to the geniuses who designed it that a mirror-smooth chromed metal surface with absolutely NO knurling, stippling or any other texture would be even MORE slippery when held in a wet hand with soapy shaving cream on it? Did anyone even try it out on a real face before they shipped it out the door?<br />- Speaking of shaving cream, the little can that comes in this set is useless. It’s as light and insubstantial as NASA Aerogel, and disappears to a thin oily layer when rubbed in. I don’t know what it is, but it’s NOT like any other shaving cream that I’ve ever used.<br />- The huge, unwieldy, six-blade head does NOT glide smoothly across the skin; the blades catch and grab at every opportunity, and do NOT shave closely.<br />- Since no blade replacements show up on Amazon, they’re clearly rare, hard to find and, if you can find them, no doubt they’re obscenely expensive.<br />- The stylish, oh-so-elegant “portfolio” that accompanies this set is the most pretentious thing that I’ve seen in a long time. I mean, it’s a RAZOR, not the latest iPad Pro!<br /><br />Anyone who spends 50 bucks for this set rather than getting it for free will surely be wildly disappointed and probably furious once they realize what they got for their money. It’s not worth 50 cents. It’s all about form over function, with form checking in at 100% and function zero.<br /><br />In the past, I’ve gotten some marginal razors through Vine, but none have been so bad that I’ve thrown them away rather than using them. This one is the exception.<br /><br />The minimum-allowed one-star rating is far too generous for this “object” that, whatever it is, doesn’t qualify as a “razor” in any practical way.

There's also the heavy base piece to stand the razor up. The shaving cream is not that great. It comes out of the can with impressive body, but once you start applying it to your face, it deflates and just doesn't provide awesome coverage. The razor is smooth on the skin, but because of its asymmetrical design, it's less comfortable in the left hand.

My opinion on each product differs a lot, so I'll provide a short review of each item.<br /><br />*Instant Foaming Cleanser: I love this one. It's my favorite. It smells wonderful, and it just feels great going on my skin and after I've rinsed it off. You really don't need much. I found that if I pressed down the top about halfway, I got enough to cover my whole face. For me, the cleanser is definitely a 5-star product.<br /><br />*Glycolic Peel Mask: While I felt like the mask did its job fine, I wasn't a fan of the smell at all. The best way that I can explain it is to say that it smells like wood to me. It's like I'm sniffing the bark of a tree. I'm not sure where that smell came from. It's not a horrible smell. It's just that I've had other masks that work just as well and have a more appealing smell. I'd probably give this one 3 stars.<br /><br />*Spray Beauty Elixir: This one is the hardest for me to review. When I first used it, I did not like it at all. While I like the smell, it's a bit overwhelming. The first time I used it, it also stung in a few spots. I know that this isn't how it was meant to be used, but I found that for me, it works best when I spray it on my hands and then pat my face with it. After using it a few times, it started to grow on me, and it does seem to moisturize my skin well. I'd give this 4 stars.<br /><br />Overall, this set evens out to 4 stars.

I definitely have to use makeup remover to get it off, so it is for sure waterproof. I also like that this color isn't pulling red on me. So often browns do that but this is nice and dark and definitely neutral. The only complaint I have is that when I open these there was a little bit of ink that had leaked out around the applicator at the top so it looked a little messy, but I love the way this works so much I don't care One thing to note is that it's best to put this on before you use any other wax or gels to keep your brow hairs in place.
