Reading the ingredients, I was impressed that the ingredients have detoxifying qualities. It really showed in the experience of how it was to use the salts.<br \/><br \/>Though the instructions said to use the entire bag, I was a little shocked by this because it's a lot of salt and also at the time of purchase, the product was listed at about $35, so it seemed way too luxurious to use the entire thing. However, I tend to agree with them that half the bag was not quite enough and when the bath was full, I couldn't really smell the fragrance anymore with just half the bag.<br \/><br \/>That said, even with just half the bag, I could feel the detoxifying qualities and after the bath I rinsed off well in the shower to remove any of the toxins that had come out through my skin.<br \/><br \/>The sharp, rough rose quartz gem that was included was a bit of a surprise. I would've expected that in a product that you're supposed to dump out into your bathtub, they would've chosen a smoother stone rather than a rough one. It had some serious sharp angles to it. I would definitely recommend fishing it out before dumping the bag in your bath so that you don't scratch your bathtub. It is beautiful, though.<br \/><br \/>Overall if the price to you seems fair for a single bath, then I highly recommend this product. The quality level is great, it's just a matter of how much do you want to spend for a single bath.","title":"Really lovely detoxing bath soak","timestamp":1619969521861}

You push the bottom and 3 dots come out onto the brush. How I apply my primer usually depends on the primer I use. There’s some I use that I apply with my fingers to help melt the product into my skin and really press it into my skin. There’s some I apply with a brush to really spread it out. A while ago I watched a video from a well known makeup artist. He said that if you want to hide your pores, you can use a brush and basically press the product INTO the pores. Yes, your occluding the pore by using the bristles on the brush to put product INTO the pores, rather than just going over the pores, but if you wash your face well at the end of the day it shouldn’t be an issue. He said when you take the brush, you use the bristles to push the product into the pores, which fills them, and leads to an even base. If you use a product that just kind of layers over the pores, they aren’t filled, they just have a layer over them. A lot of times just having a layer over them works. It creates a smooth layer to put your base on. But, throughout the day the layer kind of breaks down and you end up with your pores showing. If you had actually put product into the pores, then they would continue to be filled and leave you looking smooth all day. So, ever since then I try to use a brush when applying product where I want my pores filled. So, this coming with a built in brush was perfect!<br \/><br \/>The brush is soft. It isn’t rough or scratchy. With 1 push giving 3 dots of product onto the brush I have enough product for everywhere I want to use it.<br \/><br \/>It makes my skin nice and smooth, so I have a smooth base to apply my foundation on.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I think this is a great primer!

On the other side of the comb is a little brush you can use on your lashes, or your eyebrows.<br \/>The second tool, my favorite, has a mascara type applicator on one end, this applicator is great for grooming your eyebrows before you put on your makeup.

The eye head is slimmer and less than half the width with just four rows of needles. The eye head is an authentic and high quality attachment that snaps on easily and fits Glo Pro perfectly. I definitely prefer using this slimmer eye head for the delicate area around my eyes and between my brows and even my forehead (which is small). The smaller head gives me better control and greater ease of using Glo Pro in small areas.<br \/><br \/>I wasn’t sure of the boundaries around my eye area, so I emailed Glo Pro and was informed the eye head can be used right up to the bottom lashes (but not on the eye lids).  Still, this device is new to me so for now I don’t go much beyond the orbital bone- where I apply my night time eye cream.  The Glo Pro needles are short and feel just a little prickly and give me a slight burning sensation. But it’s not uncomfortable or painful and hasn’t caused any excessive redness or irritation. I definitely recommend the smaller eye attachment head for Glo Pro users and rate it 5 stars.<br \/><br \/>I wasn’t provided a Glo Pro device and this review is only of the eye attachment head.

I'm always keeping my eyes open for beneficial face creams and serums. I became obsessed with healthy skin after moving to Puerto Rico. We all of us know about the sun's damaging effects. It's harmful to all skin, not just those with aging skin. Algae can quite possibly reduce the breakdown of hyaluronic acid within the skin. Algae subspecies have anti-aging benefits. Undaria pinnatifida extract is shown to reduce wrinkle depth and improve over-all skin appearance. It also helps to protect the skin's natural stores of collagen and hyaluronic acid. The alteromonas ferment extract is found in deep seawater algae. It has binding properties that help hydration. Salicornia herbacea extract contains good-for-the-skin things – increasing skin barrier and deep hydration. It might even help the skin recover. Caprylic triglyceride reduces dryness and has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal properties. It will not clog pores and is suitable for people with oily skin. Arginine protects the skin from free radicals that contribute to fine lines. Arginine in cosmetics hydrates and boosts collagen production. The parfum ingredient is not damaging to the skin. Maltol and POLYQUATERNIUM-80 (plant-based) is used in cosmetics regularly and deemed safe.  NMF (Natural Moisturizing Factor) components work to keep skin supple and hydrated. The combination of these ingredients is a friend to the skin's health. Understanding what's in our products ensures that we are buying serums we actually want to put on our faces. Knowing all of this, I am 100% satisfied with applying this serum. The smell is reminiscent of cotton candy. It isn't overpowering. In fact, I think it enhances my want to use. It feels indulgent. It smells incredible. It appears to be working well for me. I have nothing to say about this product but great, great things!","title":"MOMENTUM Face Serum","timestamp":1604718908541}

I typically take my time and use it at night before bed. However, I wanted a unit on my main floor bathroom for quick use during the day without having to go back upstairs, or for use if I am going to be gone all day and want to take it with me. Therefor I have been keen on getting a portable chargeable flosser. That, and my first floor bathroom is super tiny with nowhere to put a typical flossing unit nor anywhere to plug it in. This is perfect for me!<br \/><br \/>Nice unit, right out of the box. It is attractive, feels comfortable in the hand, as is easy to get it going. While it comes with instructions, it is easy to figure out- very intuitive. USB cord is good length. The port that plugs into the unit has a pop-in cover (\"anti-fouling rubber stopper\"). It doesn't come attached, and I wish it did since I'd rather not have that area exposed to water. I sense that I will lose that cap soon enough, or just forget to use it. We'll see.<br \/><br \/>The unit comes with four attachments, all for doing different jobs- so unless someone has a need for this unit and for an attachment for something different than what you need, I would say this is for solo use. Good sized water reservoir, too.<br \/><br \/>Unlike my main unit, this one has a fairly straight nozzle in comparison. This makes it a challenge to get behind the rear most molars.

When I read about this product and the lovely smell it had, I was very excited to try it.  Let's take a look.<br \/><br \/>WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br \/>This cream is yellow in color- very pale yellow.  It is creamy but not heavy.  There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid.  They are not quite there yet, but I have used enough products over time where I recognize that smell.<br \/><br \/>That is not necessarily the fault of the cream.  This could have been kept in a hot warehouse too long, or who knows what.  The manufacture date on my box is April 2019.  That is over a year old already.<br \/><br \/>HOW DOES IT WORK?<br \/>Since it is not unbearable at this point, I wanted to at least test the product for a few days.  There was no burning or stinging, so it is still okay to use for now.  The product is quite nice.  It does soak in quickly and it does not leave the face greasy at all.<br \/><br \/>WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON SKIN?<br \/>The next morning after using this, I will say that the skin is left looking like it has a slight glow to it.  It does leave the skin looking much nicer than other creams I have used.  It is warmer weather right now and this cream is still not leaving the face greasy or heavy at all.  My skin is definitely left looking nice the next morning.<br \/><br \/>ANY SENSITIVITY?<br \/>I have not had any sensitivity to the sun or anything else yet.  Like I said, I can not use this long as it is ready to turn bad soon so I only have a short time.  For now, it is really nice.<br \/><br \/>THE BOTTOM LINE<br \/>I really wish that this cream was fresher than it is.  The product manufacture date on it is April of 2019.  I am really disappointed that I could not test it at its best because it has great potential to be a really nice cream.<br \/><br \/>MY RATING<br \/>FOUR STARS- I can not give this five stars in its current state.

So, in the product photo, the nails with rhinestones are on the thumb, pointing finger, and middle finger. I usually prefer my nails with accents (like rhinestones to either be on the thumb and ring finger or pointer and ring finger, not the first 3). I couldn’t find a nail to fit my middle finger, except for one with rhinestones so I ended up with rhinestones I’m the first 4 fingers, and I just didn’t like the look of that.

They aren't allowed to go to a real nail salon\/spa yet so I planned an at home \"spa day\" for them, with their mom's approval of course. The foot spa uses batteries so I was able to do this anywhere and not have to worry about being close to an outlet. However, that could also be a \"negative\" as you have to worry about replacing batteries. We always have plenty of batteries at home anyway for our gadgets so it wasn't an issue. They had to \"wait in line\" for their turn while I painted their toes and gave them a stack of magazines to flip through. It was such a fun experience for them without having to spend a fortune, and in the safety of our home. The foot spa machine itself is pretty cool, and is almost like the one I have for myself. I did use warm water - the machine doesn't heat up or anything, so make sure you use lukewarm water for the little feets! I went a step further and even gave them an exfoliating foot scrub which is something I already have at home for myself. This is honestly the best $40 spent - an experience like this in a \"real\" salon and spa would have easily cost more than $40 for two girls. The great thing about this is that it is a suitable item for a wide range of ages, even after they've entered their teen years.

I do like the compact size, but wish there was more grip to the exterior. Everything is smooth and I came close to dropping the thing the first time I used it. So be careful handling it.

Your skin must be clean, dry and free of any moisturizers.  They stick well to my skin and definitely pulls it up some.  However, the skin that's pulled up gets crinkled up and if your hair doesn't cover it, the crinkles will show.  The tapes are really hard to see once applied, and easy to apply once you get the hang of it.  I blew through at least 10 just trying to figure it out but you get 40 in a box.

I can usually get the top pretty smooth but have some baby hairs and bad hair days where little hairs stick out and adding more of my regular lightweight gel or other products can weigh my hair down too much, make it look wet or dirty or make it clumpy or stiff. I don’t know why but I didn’t have high hopes that this Wing Fly Grl Mane Taming Wand gel would be anything special, but it really works great for my fine hair.<br \/><br \/>It’s about the size of a mascara and has a wand with a small foam type applicator (similar to one on a lip gloss) at the end. I just gently run it over the hairs sticking up on top and they just lay down and blend right in with the rest of my hair.  I can’t say how this works for thick hair, but it sure is fast and easy to use and works great for me. My hair is very dark brown and I can’t see any sign of the gel, just the benefit of smooth hair.<br \/><br \/>I haven’t experienced any flaking, dryness, stiffness, wet look, burning or discomfort or issues with my hair color. This wand is convenient as it’s so compact and easy to carry in my purse on-the-go.

The eye patches are gel patches and not meant to be wet with serum - the serum is released by the gel when it's in contact with skin.  The patches easily stayed in place, but resulted in no visible improvements, and left my undereye area feeling a little dehydrated.  The lip patch is also a gel patch.  It was odd to wear, but it stayed on while I moved around and almost seemed to form a suction seal around my mouth after 10 minutes.  I liked this patch - it left my lips smooth and soft for a day and a half...nice!  The foot booties are for moisturizing only...these are NOT exfoliating booties that take days to work and lead to skin peeling.  They were easy to use and comfortable to wear.  I wore them for 30 minutes and was quite pleased with how soft my feet still felt after 2 days.  My only issue was that after removing the booties I had to spend a good amount of time massaging in the lotion left on my feet...seriously, even after trying to dry them with a towel my feet felt greasy.  Be sure to allow time for the product to absorb afterwards and don't plan to run out the door like I did.  For all of this, I would give the set 4 stars.  However, there's an EXCESSIVE amount of packaging.  The patches all have plastic protectors on both sides, are enclosed in plastic clam shells, and are sealed in the final package.

There's almost no scent to the essence, maybe a very faint scent of citrus if I were to pinpoint, which is ideal for people who have sensitive nose.<br \/><br \/>I am not a chemist so the ingredients described have no meaning to me. Though, the essence contains hyaluronic acid which is the main ingredient in the toner that I use for final stage of my daily facial cleaning process. The toner is a lot thicker in content and leaves my skin sticky whereas this essence is very water based and feels amazing after applying. My skin reacted and absorbed the essence right away and left my skin smooth and moisturized without feeling any stickiness. Even my hands got moisturized and I do not have to wipe or wash away after the application. I learned through reading the product description that this essence contains low molecular weight hyaluronic acid, which with its small molecular structure makes it easier for it to absorb into the skin. This speaks true to the application because I use the essence right after I wash my face and this sets the base for my skincare routine and helps maxmize the absorbtion of other products.<br \/><br \/>Without reading too much into it, this is a five-star product that is lightweight with almost no scent, keeps your skin moisturized and hydrated, and prepped for your daily skin care routine.","title":"Lightweight, High Absorption, Moisturizing Essence for Foundation of Skin Care Routine","timestamp":1624307934053}

My mid range ones, the hairs can sometimes get kind of splayed out when they’re drying if they don’t have something holding them in place. With the MANY brush sets I’ve gotten, I have gotten tons of the brush protectors that came on the bigger brushes, but those were stretched out from being on a brush already, so I needed new ones. These are great. Since they stretch out when you put them on a brush, if you use one for a bigger sized brush, you’ll either have to always use that protector for the same brush or at least a brush of the same size. The same goes for the ones you use on smaller brushes. I only have a few brushes that need the brush protectors, so I can easily keep track of which ones go on which brushes, so it’s not a big deal for me. Before I had the brush protectors, I would take a piece of toilet paper, split it into 1 ply, and the tightly wrap that around the brush to hold the hairs in place while it dried. This worked fine, but it was a hassle to have to get the toilet paper and split it into plys. Then when it would get wet from the brush when I was trying to roll the toilet paper around the brush, it would start to rip. So, using these brush protectors is a lot less hassle! And I can just continue to reuse the same one on the same brushes, so it’s not like the toilet paper where I’d have to get a new one every time!<br \/><br \/>The brush cleaning mat is just a basic silicone brush cleaning mat. It has little suctions on the bottom so you can place it on the counter to have it hold in place while you scrub the brushes on it, which is nice so it won’t be moving around.<br \/><br \/>There’s different textures for different types of brushes. The product page states what each one is for…<br \/><br \/>The pinstripe pattern at the top between the ears is to rinse smaller brushes. (Notice this area says it’s for RINSING smaller brushes, while the heart shaped area says it’s for SCRUBBING smaller brushes).<br \/><br \/>The thick striped pattern around the ears is to “reshape big makeup brushes.” I’m not sure what reshape them means.<br \/><br \/>The 2 big dot patterns below the eyes is “suitable for blush brushes, separating oil by up and down friction.”<br \/><br \/>The small dot pattern that goes around the 2 areas of big dot pattern is suitable for cleaning eyeshadow brushes.<br \/><br \/>The I-shaped area on the left side of the body is suitable for cleaning concealer and eyeshadow brushes.<br \/><br \/>The heart shaped areas in the middle of the body is for scrubbing small brushes. Notice this area says it’s for SCRUBBING smaller brushes, while the pinstripe pattern at the top between the ears says it’s for RINSING smaller brushes).<br \/><br \/>The U-shaped area on the right side of the body is suitable for cleaning concealer and eyeshadow brushes.<br \/><br \/>Personally, I don’t really notice if one area cleans brushes better than other areas. I tend to use the ones that have bigger, higher up grooves, like the heart shaped area for scrubbing brushes that have foundation and concealer in them. I find these really get in there and clean out the liquid foundation\/concealer well. Any of the smaller areas work well for my eyeshadow brushes.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I think this is a great little set. You get the cleaning mat which is a good size with many different areas and has the suction cups on the bottom that can hold it in place. Plus you get the brush protection nets, which is nice.

It sadly didn’t work for either purpose.<br \/><br \/>There are two sides on the brush:  one has little silicone fingers for regular exfoliation, and the other has…well, I don’t know what to call it.  The manufacturer says it has “short” bristles but it doesn’t.  They claim you can use it for deep exfoliation but I don’t see how.  It doesn’t have any holes on that side so the inside sponge can’t get any soap on to that side.  So it just kind of rubbed my skin raw because of the dryness…and not in a good way.<br \/><br \/>As for the side with the little silicone fingers…that does, indeed, have some holes to let the sponge inside squeeze the soap foam out.  But I had to really squeeze the brush several times to get anything out onto the surface of the brush…and then had to keep stopping and squeezing some more.

It has a more upscale look and feel to it, plus adds a battery gauge to show the charge level. However, the shave quality is the same – OK, but not a standout.<br \/><br \/>The case feels more solid than the LifeProof and, while it’s more of a traditional look, I think they did a nice job with the overall aesthetics. It is pretty grippy even with wet hands. It does not, however, feel as comfortable to hold as the more sculpted models such as most of the Panasonic shavers and some Braun shavers.<br \/><br \/>The shave quality of this model is identical to that of the LifeProof: very Remington in how it feels (close, but rather aggressive). Performance is best on the easy spots (cheek) but not as good on the more trickier spots (neck and jawline). The flex head helps with dealing with face contours but it lacks enough travel to do an excellent quality job.<br \/><br \/>The aggressiveness of the shave is dialed down when using it wet. It needs a very, very thin layer of shave cream (the gel style creams work well) or the head gets bogged down.<br \/><br \/>Love the trimmer! The positioning could be improved to make it easier to use, but it cuts very cleanly on sideburns and ‘shash trimming.<br \/><br \/>The controls are clean, easy to read and tell you all you need to know (charge and battery status).<br \/><br \/>I like the feel of this better than the Wahl LifeProof, but the shave quality keeps this at the same rating (average, which is 3 stars).

After this last time, i thought i would give Oral B a try to see how they hold up.<br \/><br \/>The toothbrush heads are very different. Sonicare uses a more oval shape that is smaller than a regular toothbrush(which i like because it can fit in your mouth easier) and Oral B uses a circular shape. I feel that the Oral B cleans your gums a bit better because it is more wide and can reach your gums, even when you're not trying to, just when you're normally brushing your teeth. The slimmer oval shape of the sonicares do not do this when you're doing a normal brushing. I feel as though this could be a plus or a con depending on the individual. some people have sensitive gums and may not like that you cannot control the Oral B to stay away from the gums, however it gets the job done all at once. Between the two, they both do a great job of getting your teeth feeling very clean, sonicare may do it very slightly better, but both are MUCH better than a regular toothbrush. I could never go back.<br \/><br \/>The vibrations of the sonicares are, i feel, more controlled. When i use the Oral B's i can feel the vibrating in my head and my vision gets a little weird while i'm brushing, the sonicares do not do this. This was the biggest issue for me when using the Oral B's. It's a bit annoying.<br \/><br \/>The brush heads are VERY expensive for the sonicares! I buy mine from costco, and i spend about $50 for 7 brush heads. For one person, thats not so bad, but when you have a family of four, thats $50+ every 6 months. So maintaining them is not cheap. Oral B is about $40 for 8. They're a little bit cheaper, not by too much, but enough to give you something to think about.<br \/><br \/>Overall i would say the Sonicares perform better, but often break. While the Oral B are cheaper, and last longer. If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line.

I began by backing up my QuickBooks desktop Pro 2018, and then began the installation process. It went smoothly and quickly and didn't take very long. I used the express installation which was recommended, and the whole thing was very easily done, retaining all of my previous settings and information.<br \/><br \/>The part that was awful was that I have an existing payroll subscription and had to call into tech-support to upgrade that portion of things. Luckily I was aware of this so when simply entering the information into QuickBooks didn't work, I knew that I was in for a phone call. About 45 minutes later of being on hold and trying to be up sold on QuickBooks online by an Indian tech-support person (hey guys, I just got desktop Pro 2019 upgraded, please don't sell me on QuickBooks online), I was good to go.<br \/><br \/>I think it's absolutely offensive that after you've purchased a software product like this they make you call in as a matter of course to activate. Anybody using this product is either being paid by the hour or runs a business and does not have that kind of spare time to sit around wasting on a process that should be 30 seconds of data entry.<br \/><br \/>I have multiple employees and so end up paying an additional 4 to 8 dollars per month for the subscription to add additional employees. It's another two dollars a month per employee after the first one. Also, be aware that the setting is set to subscribe you to an annual payroll subscription, which if done through QuickBooks will cost you about $420. Purchasing the new upgrade of desktop Pro 2019 with the payroll for a year costs less than that, so being automatically billed such a high amount for just the payroll is offensive and ridiculous.<br \/><br \/>I would really like QuickBooks as a company to reconsider how they deal with their payroll subscriptions and activation of payroll that has already been purchased, because this is a huge problem that is been garnering them poor reviews and lots of bad press for some time. I personally have considered many times changing to a more congenial company just to avoid this particular dance every single year. Do I pay $420 to avoid being on the phone for 45 minutes with somebody from India who act like I've done something terribly wrong by purchasing my payroll upgrade on Amazon along with the software upgrade? Or do I do as I have done most years and purchase the yearly upgrade that comes with the enhanced payroll.<br \/><br \/>As an FYI, the enhanced payroll really does make it very easy to run your quarterly reports and do your e-filing. I did it myself for many years, but now hand the file back and forth to my bookkeeper via email as a portable file.","title":"Desktop Pro 2019 works great; upgrading an existing payroll subscription is awful","timestamp":1556724639735}

The mascara is very black and bold on the lashes (I have brown lashes and it pops in color). The fibers are there, there are very many of them and wand builds on those fibers very very well with every application stroke. There are two things that make me uncomfortable about this mascara. First is the smell of it. It is a very strong \/ pungent chemical smell that does not smell like your average mascara from a drug or department store. Second, it is made in China. Maybe I am paranoid, but learning a little of how cheap cosmetics are made oversees, the smell reminds me of all the descriptions from those documentaries. On the bright side (aside the smell), my eyes did not sting upon application, the mascara did not shed, and removing it (although it is waterproof) was very easy with regular miscellar water and a cotton pad. Because of the smell, not a product I would purchase again or give as a gift.

Initially, I chose this particular set for the larger sized funnels that are also included, and the fact that it comes with (10) travel sized bottles.<br \/><br \/>None of my bottles leak and they spray a fine, even mist without leaving droplets.  After seeing the spray function in action, I decided to use a couple of these for facial mists and essences. I don't know (yet) whether they'll spray every last drop, but the sprayer feed wraps all the way around the bottom of the bottle, which does look promising. 🤞 So far, every liquid I've put in them has been fine; the plastic didn't change and the sprays perform the same.<br \/><br \/>Ultimately, I had to dock a star from my rating because the bottles came filthy inside, 😬 every one of them is heavily scratched up, and one of the bottles I received doesn't sit evenly. ➡️(see photos 3&4: defect (warped) bottle is on the right)⬅️<br \/><br \/>PRO'S:<br \/>+ Contains everything you need to package liquids immediately<br \/>+ Includes larger sized funnels = quick flow in filling<br \/>+ Spray nozzles produce fine, even mist without leaving droplets<br \/>+ Sprayer feed goes all the way around the bottom of the bottle<br \/>+ No leaking from the bottle necks or spray nozzles<br \/>+ Spray nozzles have not clogged<br \/>+ Caps fit tightly<br \/>+ No adverse reactions to the plastic (re: high alcohol content)<br \/>+ Airline approved carry-on size<br \/>+ Excellent price for ten bottles (and two funnels!)<br \/>+ Convenient PRIME shipping<br \/>+ Bonus sheet of labels (they're small, but they work)<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>- Bottles came really scratched up and very dirty<br \/>- One of the ten bottles I received doesn't sit evenly<br \/><br \/>SUMMARY:<br \/>Ultimately, I think there's some quality control issues that the manufacturer could improve upon.

If you don’t like the smell of cloves, then do not order this because that is the most predominant smell in my opinion. I like it though- it has a nice spicy kick.<br \/><br \/>The soap definitely feels different than I expected. It doesn’t feel really smooth like many soaps. When dry, they were slightly powdery when I ran my finger across. They are slightly gritty feeling which I noticed more once the soap became wet in the shower. This could be nice if you like a slight scrubby feeling. I typically rub it onto my mesh bath sponge or silicone sponge so I don’t really care about the grittiness either way. I found that it lathers and suds up very well with both my mesh and silicone sponges.<br \/><br \/>I just started using, so I’m not sure how many showers I’ll be able to get out of each bar. Honestly, I thought they might disintegrate and get used up fast simply based on how powdery they felt when dry. I don’t think it will last as long as some other soaps, but I was still surprised that I could somewhat see the outline of where the shallow cross was imprinted on the soap even after my first shower-and I did intentionally scrub my sponges all over that side pretty vigorously. I took a picture of what the soap looked like after one shower compared to unused bars.<br \/><br \/>Anyway, my skin feels very clean, perhaps even a little moisturized after using and I haven’t experienced any irritation to my sensitive skin (I have eczema).<br \/><br \/>I like that this soap is natural and free from harmful chemicals. I also love that it is made in the USA-Ohio specifically, which is where I am from.<br \/><br \/>I’ll be sure to update my review if any issues arise like if I find that the bars do in fact get used far too quickly. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!!!","title":"Interesting Gritty Texture And Strong Clove Scent","timestamp":1611627119713}

The box itself was nicely packaged. For reference, I used the thinnest\/most natural pair at the top for my review.<br \/><br \/>Cons: the tube of eyeliner was either sitting so long it completely dried up, or the glue caused the eyeliner to adhere to the inside of the tube, but it was almost impossible to get ANY of the liner on my lid.<br \/><br \/>When I finally got a line to go on, it was akin to what attempting to using a dried up Expo on whiteboard looks like- I had to scrub the pen on my eyelid in an attempt to lay down any product at all, resulting in a very pitiful looking eyeliner application.<br \/><br \/> I fixed the lashes to the appropriate area, and within 5 minutes they were coming off at the corners. I tried to remedy the overall result somewhat by adding my own liner, and that example is on the second photo, bottom right corner (photo with eyeshadow applied).<br \/><br \/>The lashes themselves were the quality you’d expect from a multi pack at this price.

I chose the morning to do the mask while I was having my morning coffee, checking the computer, and using my LED White light therapy lamp. The Mask itself is made of a very durable fabric like material that does not tear. The serum is nice and silky feeling without any scent, that I could tell. I appreciate that, as I have a sensitivity to certain smells.<br \/>For me, the mask was a little bit short on the forehead and not wide enough on the cheeks. I don't have a large face at all, and I had quite a bit of skin left to cover around the sides and top.<br \/>There's an ample amount of serum left in the package that I was able to keep re-wetting the mask with, as it seemed to dry fairly quickly. I also rubbed some on my neck and decollete. I left it on for about an hour, so that my skin could soak in as much as possible. I then used the mask to rub the rest on my neck, decollete, and the backs of my hands. I wanted to make use of every bit I could. I use Retin-A on my face, and had done a treatment the night before, so my skin really needed the hydration and nourishment. It looked and felt very hydrated and nourished afterwards.<br \/>The only thing I did not care for was that my skin was very sticky after removing the mask, and it stayed that way. I ended up having to take a damp cloth and blotting it off. After that, my face felt a bit greasy, and I had to keep blotting it until it was time for my bedtime skincare routine.<br \/>Overall, I really enjoyed using this mask and will be using it at least once a week. It is very hydrating and nourishing, I just wish it didn't leave the sticky and greasy feeling behind. Maybe, I left it on too long, as I do have combination normal to oily skin. Next time I will only leave it on for about 15 minutes, as I think that may work much better for me.

I used Glo Pro regularly for about 2-1\/2 months, 2-3 times a week. I’m 57 and felt my skin did look particularly good with regular use. While results weren’t dramatic in that my wrinkles didn’t magically disappear, I feel the overall appearance of my skin seemed brighter, firmer and some lines seemed less noticeable. Around my eyes and cheeks aren’t big problem areas (except dark circles), but my fine lines looked virtually nonexistent in those areas and I feel I looked more refreshed and my skin looked more taut. The frown lines by my mouth are my worst issue and those didn’t improve as much as I hoped, but I did think the lines seemed less noticeable and the area seemed less saggy or firmer to me.<br \/><br \/>I decided to take a break of about a month to see if I stopped if I’d notice a difference.  I don’t think my skin looks as good as it did when using Glo Pro regularly. I feel I look less refreshed, my frown lines look worse and my skin seems kind of dull. I can’t speak to the science of whether micro needing really increases collagen production (or if it can damage the skin), or if my benefit is because it increases absorption of my arsenal of serums and creams. But I do think I looked better from use and my skin doesn’t look as good since I stopped. It’s a tool that I’ve gone back to using, and I do really like using a lot.  I apply quality serums and creams within 60 seconds of using Glo Pro and do think I get bigger benefits from my products. I personally avoid using AHA and retinol products after Glo Pro as they’re too irritating for my sensitive skin.<br \/><br \/>I don’t find Glo Pro painful to use. The needles feel just a little prickly and give me a slight burning sensation. But it’s not uncomfortable or painful and hasn’t caused me any excessive redness, irritation or bleeding. I’ve seen videos of bleeding caused by micro needling done by professionals and read that going that deep isn’t required for micro needling to work. I only use Glo Pro at night and never wake with any redness or irritation. I do use the Glo Pro Pads after I cleanse to sanitize in order to avoid bacteria spread as I got a few blemishes after I ran out but don’t get blemishes using the pads (and alcohol is much too harsh for my dry skin).  I always keep the included spritz bottle filled with alcohol and spray the head after every use. While subjective, I do feel my skin looks better from using Glo Pro regularly with good treatment products and rate it 5 stars.","title":"While Subjective, I Do Think My Skin Looks Better Using Glo Pro Regularly W\/ Good Products","timestamp":1546801048210}

For daytime, I do have 100% squalane that I tend to prefer to this Booster oil just because it’s so lightweight yet gives me that extra moisture and softness. But I’d rather use like the the Booster oil blend at night as it has additional ingredients beyond squalane that add benefits, such as antioxidant and fatty acid rich sunflower seed oil.<br \/><br \/>At night, I’ve tried this Booster oil various ways. I’ve applied it after cleansing and toning but would rather use a regular serum. I’ve mixed it with my night cream and have also applied after my cream.

I like waking up to skin that still feels hydrated and comfortable.<br \/><br \/>I’m impressed that this Booster oil emphasizes natural and gentle ingredients, and it also lacks chemical fragrance. I do smell a hint of lavender oil. It can be an irritant form some and can give me headaches if it’s too strong. Luckily, it’s subtle enough not to cause an issue.

Judging from the website it's supposed to be off-white, actually called \"classic linen,\" but the ones they sent out seem to be more beige.

About a year ago I fell in love with a heated mask that you have to microwave, I loved how it felt but I ended up not using it often because the timing of heating it up in the microwave never quite worked out for me. Either I would heat it up before I headed upstairs and then by the time I got into bed it would be cold, or I would get ready for bed and then be too lazy to go back downstairs to get it and heat it up. This USB plug in mask solves the problem entirely! Now I can get ready for bed and then use this once I'm in bed to help me relax and fall asleep. I find myself using it almost every night because of how convenient it is.<br \/><br \/>It heats up very quickly and has a great range of 3 temperatures. It also has 3 options for the timer which is very convenient\/a great safety feature for me since sometimes it relaxes me to sleep. Low and medium is where I keep it, medium is almost too warm for me so I haven't even tried the highest setting honestly. One side definitely heats up more than the other so keep that in mind when using it. It is very soft and fits perfectly over my eyes. It's small enough that with the strap holding it tight it presses in perfectly onto my eyes.<br \/><br \/>My only suggestion would be to make it a little less dense, while the material is very soft the mask itself is very full and kind of hard because it is so full. My microwave version is larger so it covers more than just my eyes and is less dense so it has a more giving feel to it which I do prefer a bit. A small style change could definitely make this mask my sould mate.

I have had no other experience with them, so take my opinion with a grain of salt! I played around with these twice. The first time, I couldn't stand how they felt at the outer edges of my eyes. The liner was easy to put on, but the lashes themselves? Not so much. I was finally able to reposition them to where my eyes felt comfortable. They made a BIG difference in how my eyes looked-so much so that it surprised me.  The second time I tried them, things went a bit more smoothly and definitely faster. They looked great, but again I had to adjust them a little bit because my eye lid was getting irritated.<br \/><br \/>Not gonna lie, the problems I had with these were most likely MY problems and not the fault of the lashes. Since I've not tried the glue on type before, I have nothing to compare these to.

Using ordinary nail polish didn't have that effect.<br \/><br \/>Previously:<br \/>These are convenient for travel but I found that using one pad just isn't enough to remove the nail polish from both hands, especially if you have glitter or gel. When you rip open the packet, the cloth is heavily saturated with nail remover and when you unfold it it's about the size of one of those wet naps you get when you eat greasy food. I draped the cloth over both hands and pressed my nails against it, but though I used every inch of the cloth and squeezed out as much product as I could, I still had leftover polish on the edges of my fingers. Not wanting to waste a whole other cloth to finish the job, I blotted the remainder using a cotton ball and my usual polish remover.<br \/><br \/>Overall, it's strong and will remove most of your polish, but the cost of this product is higher than if you stocked up on a few bottles of nail polish remover and used cotton balls. But if you're traveling, it would definitely be  more convenient and I suppose that's what you're be paying for.

I also tried the Celleanser Clean Toner Mist, and the Celleanser Clean Serum. They all worked nicely for my dry, sensitive skin, and they worked nicely together.<br \/><br \/>This cream has a thick and creamy texture. It is very smooth and soothing to apply to the skin. It soaks in well, but it doesn't disappear. It leaves a nice layer of extra hydration and moisture on the skin. Though, it is lightweight and breathable. Not heavy at all. It is not sticky, and it layers perfectly with other products. The scent is sort of lightly herbal or earthy, similar to many Korean skincare brands.<br \/><br \/>I will say that the finish isn't my go-to. It isn't really dewy or glowy. But I wouldn't call it extremely matte either. Maybe somewhere in-between, but more toward the matte side. I typically like to use dewy, glowy skincare, so I would probably use this product at night for that reason.<br \/><br \/>The packaging is a nice 60ml tube with a flip-top cap. A little goes a long way, and I imagine this tube will last me a while. At $19.99 for 60ml \/ 2.02 fl. oz., it's an excellent deal. Especially because the ingredient list is nice.<br \/><br \/>I haven't been using it long enough to speak on the long-term results, but I do like the cream so far, and I will definitely continue to use it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the ingredient list and wants to give it a try.<br \/><br \/>A NOTE TO CELLEANSER: It would be wonderful to add accurate, full ingredient lists to all of your products listed on Amazon. It would go a long way toward helping your customers save time and make informed decisions without any hesitations or uncertainties.

{"user_id":"AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1","item_id":"B09CLNDMXX","rating":5,"review_text":"I have loved a lot of the By Terry products I’ve tried. I tried a mini of the loose Hyaluronic Hydra Powder, so I was excited to try the pressed powder version of it. But, I recently tried the By Terry Hyaluronic Hydra-Powder palette that had 4 different pressed Hyaluronic hydra-powders in it. It had colored powders, not translucent like this one. I got the “Fair to Medium” so it contained a pale pink, a pale bone colored shade, a pale bronzer, and a light bronzer shade. I didn’t like the light colored shades at all for setting my makeup. They seemed to make my skin look so dry, which I thought was so weird since it’s just a pressed version of the loose Hyaluronic hydra powder, which I loved. But, the loose Hyaluronic Hydra Powder only had 2 ingredients - silica and hyaluronic acid. The Hyaluronic Hydra-Powder Palette had a lot more ingredients, so I’m guessing that’s where the difference came from. They were also colored and the loose powder was translucent. This pressed powder is also translucent. It does contain more than 2 ingredients, I guess since it’s in pressed form rather than loose. But not a ton of ingredients (full list at end of review). But, given it had more ingredients and they were similar to the ones in the Hyaluronic Hydra-Pressed Powder Palette I tried and didn’t like, I was worried I wasn’t going to like this one either. But, I’m glad I tried it because I ended up loving it!<br \/><br \/>This comes in a nice outer product box. It comes in a nice compact with clasp closure, a mirror in the lid, and a powder puff. I never use the powder puffs that come in compacts like this, but it seemed nice enough.<br \/><br \/>The powder is very thin. It almost seems like you don’t pick any up when you dip your brush into it, but you do. Usually when I dip my brush into a powder, I have to dab off the excess from the brush before applying it to my face. I don’t have to do that with this. It only picks up a light amount, which is just enough for a very light layer. I have normal to dry skin, more on the dry side with some extremely dry areas. This doesn’t dry out my skin like the powders did in the palette that I tried. This goes on smoothly, sets my makeup in place with a very light layer, and doesn’t look dry, powdery, or cakey on the skin. It lasts well throughout the day.<br \/><br \/>I did notice that if I applied too much, I could get a dry look and feel to my skin. It’s so thin that it’s easy to think you haven’t applied any and to add more, which is when I get the dry look and feel to my skin. With the Pressed Powder Palette I tried, I found those powders worked well with a thin layer and didn’t leave my skin looking and feeling dry, but they also didn’t seem to set my makeup in place unless I applied more, which ended up giving me the dry look and feel. With this powder, I can apply a very small amount and my makeup seems to be set in place well and I don’t get a dry look and feel to the skin. So, I’m not sure why I got such a different result with the powders in the Pressed Powder Palette vs this one. Given they have similar ingredient lists aside from the color ingredients, the only thing I can think of is that this one is translucent and those ones in the palette were colored so that much<br \/><br \/>Overall, I think this is a great powder! It’s very thin and looks like nothing on the skin, but sets my makeup in place. It doesn’t feel or look dry on my skin.

This sunscreen is very unique to me in that it isn’t white, it isn’t simply beige tinted, but looks dusty rose\/beige tinted.<br \/><br \/>So there are definitely some things about this product that I kind of dislike\/ am on the fence about, but ultimately, The end result is surprisingly awesome.<br \/><br \/>What I don’t like-<br \/>I usually start with what I like, but I noticed all the things I didn’t like very quickly, so I’ll start with that.<br \/><br \/>-The pump dispenser. I don’t know what is going on with this thing, but I opened the box and tried pumping a couple times- nothing came out. I thought nothing of it since it usually takes multiple or many pumps initially to get any product into the pump..... but it never came. I started shaking the bottle and then pumping..... nothing. I almost gave up, but then violently started pumping it by hammering the top with my hand-tiny little bits started to splash out. After some more hammering, it seems to start coming out normally with a simple press. The product it pretty thick, so that could have been a factor I suppose? Now it is easier for it to come out, but still stops occasionally. When I press, the product usually comes out at the very end of a full pump.<br \/>-Not incredibly easy to spread and rub in properly. It isn’t terrible and I wasn’t too surprised since it is fairly thick and it is sunscreen, but it did require some effort to work it into my skin.<br \/>-It feels somewhat grainy\/gritty when I’m trying to rub it into my skin. I’m not sure why or if it is just the product I received. I can’t feel any granules on my face after application, but it was definitely there initially which I thought was odd.<br \/>-I had a sensation of wanting to wash my hands afterwards. I could definitely feel it lingering on my fingers.<br \/><br \/>After all that, I felt a little disappointed... but you know what? I really like the end result and the way it makes me look.<br \/><br \/>What I like-<br \/><br \/>-Really subtle natural scent- almost like the smell of clay with a hint of rose. I like it. I do see in the ingredients that there is also lavender oil.<br \/>-The tinted color... it is like a dusty rose beige. I really like it. I have somewhat tannish olive skin and something about this color is making my skin look good. It is almost like I’m wearing light makeup. Somehow my skin looks brighter and glowy after application.<br \/>-Doesn’t feel so heavy as I’m wearing. I’ll admit- the product is thick, feels somewhat grainy with application, and is not the easiest to rub in, but it feels light sitting on my face. Yes, even after washing hands, I can feel it is there when I run my fingers across my face, but it feels soft. There is a little bit of friction like it doesn’t feel completely silky smooth, but I’m not bothered by it.<br \/>-Doesn’t leave a white cast. I suppose this isn’t surprising since it isn’t white to begin with.... but I love that. Does it leaves cast? Kind of, but in a good way. Like I said, I feel like it leaves a very slight color that evens out my skin, almost like light makeup.<br \/><br \/>I really wanted to leave a 3 star rating because the pump is annoying and frustrating, the grittiness is strange, and it isn’t the easiest to rub in, but darn I like how my skin looks afterwards!!! It doesn’t make any sense to me. It almost feels like it would leave my skin feeling and looking greasy\/oily, but it doesn’t- my skin looks nice and somewhat dewy.<br \/><br \/>If the company finds a way to make the pump dispenser work properly and possibly make it feel easier to apply then this would without a doubt be a 5 star product! I also wish the bottle was larger than 50ml, especially considering the hassle of the pump.<br \/><br \/>Anyway, I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so. I would love to know!!

I think it would be easier to maneuver for the beard if it were just a little narrower.  However, with the size it is you can cover more area much more quickly, with fewer passes.  It removes the hair very well with just one pass.  It doesn't come with oil but it is recommended you oil this as needed.  It comes with a cable for charging.  Because it is cordless, I can use it anywhere and that is very convenient.  The clips go one easy and can be a little harder to get off.  The more I'm using them though, the more accustomed to it I am becoming.","title":"Basic, Good Quality, Affordable","timestamp":1535415555705}

My favorite has been Kiehl's Creme de Corps Soy Milk & Honey Body Polish, and I haven't really found anything that I like as much as that. I wanted to try this because I like the brand C'est Moi, and also because this product comes in a handy jar, which makes it so easy to scoop out and apply to skin.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, this product didn't live up to my expectations. It does have excellent exfoliators and feels like a good scrub for the skin all over my body, but the residue it leaves on my skin is icky. It's just too much - kind of feels like a coating of Crisco on my skin.<br \/><br \/>Also, the scent is odd. It doesn't smell like vanilla. It smells like... well, it's hard to explain. It's just off, and I had an aversion to it.","title":"Greasy Residue and Scent is Odd","timestamp":1619807860874}

The fact that it comes with a number of spare heads is also good, so you wont be left wanting more.  However the brushing action is simply a vibrating action that will get your teeth cleaner than a regular brushing but not quite as good as an oscillating rotational design BUT considering this toothbrush is about half the price of the competition, that's not too bad.

The scent seems to be reactivated by arm movement.

If you've frequently found yourself with body odor issues during or after exercise, this can be a very good thing. My main problem is that I'm not a fan of the strong scent. It's just a bit overbearing for my tastes. There are other similar deodorants in this series (the &#34;Cool Rush&#34; version smells better to me) which I'd go for.

I included the ingredients at the end of my review.<br \/><br \/>You get 3 glosses - a peachy pink toned one that has a strawberry scent\/flavor, a more reddish toned one that has a grape scent\/flavor, and a clear one that has a bubble gum scent\/flavor. As for the scents, I can notice them when applying, not so much after the fact. I don’t really notice a taste really with any of them, but the ingredients do list “flavor” not fragrance\/parfum, so it made me think they’d have more taste to them. Not a big deal to me though.<br \/><br \/>While 2 of them are tinted in color, the color doesn’t really translate onto the lips. They just look clear on the lips. They don’t change any color of lip liner, lipstick, matte lip, etc. that I put them over top of. So, I liked that.<br \/><br \/>The formula is nice. It feels nice and moisturizing on the lips, which I expected given they have nice moisturizing ingredients like Shea butter, coconut oil, and squalane. They do feel SLIGHTLY sticky on the lips. I hate sticky glosses, but these aren’t overly sticky. They don’t feel thick or heavy on the lips. They feel nice and thin. They are glosses so they do need re-applied often throughout the day. But, I’m used to that with glosses so it’s not a big deal to me.<br \/><br \/>The strawberry and grape both have micro glitter in them (mica). I didn’t know that when I got these. None of the product photos showed they had glitter and the description didn’t say it either. I’m not a fan of micro glitter in my lip glosses. I feel once the gloss wears off, it usually leaves behind glitter particles on my lips. Also, they can sometimes feel gritty. So, I was surprised when I saw 2 of the 3 had glitter. Luckily, these didn’t feel gritty. I do notice that there are some glitter particles on my lips after they wear off, but it’s not too bad. The glitter particles are really small, so it’s not really noticeable. So, I don’t mind that.<br \/><br \/>Overall, these are nice glosses with a nice formula. They might seem pricey when seeing the $30 price tag, but you’re getting 3 tubes of glosses, so that’s only $10 a piece, which isn’t bad. Of course, it isn’t great. You can get a tube of gloss that looks great and works just as well from the drugstore for slightly less. But, the ingredients might make it worth it to spend the little more.

That’s impossible to find. They work great and stay on my whole 12 hour shift. They are waterproof and you can’t scrub off with just water, not that a person would try. Cold cream works ok. But if you get some lash cleaner or makeup remover and apply to the end of a cotton swab and gently rub along lash, they practically fall off in seconds. At first, I was peeling them off because I thought since it’s magnetic that’s all that’s sticking. But then it’s hard to get the eyeliner off. After using a remover it’s much better. Don’t worry if you have trouble using liquid eyeliner. I promise after practicing a time or two, it will work perfect. If you get out of line, very quickly wipe off excess. It dries quickly. If it takes longer to put them on after applying liner, it will probably still work good. If you put lashes on sooner than you are supposed to and it’s not dried as well as it should be, it still works. It’s just a little messier for the lashes after removing them. I’ve learned to also use my lash remover or makeup remover to clean my lashes afterwards. They will have some liner dried to them and this builds up. I put them in my palm and squirt some on and gently rub with my finger or a swab. I don’t take much effort but get some of it off pretty good. They last me a good 5 or more times depending on how bad I bend them putting on lol. That’s another thing, you don’t have to have a real steady hand to apply them. I use my fingers instead of the holder thing. I normally start in the center but sometimes on the inside. You can adjust them if they are too long on one side. You can also trim them. Please don’t do this while they are on lol. I tried this and cut too much off. I was lazy lol. Most the time I have mine bent good to put on. Well, I should say curved instead of bent lol. They aren’t as fragile as they would seem. I love them. Only thing that worries me, if you ever are in an accident with them on and they take you for an MRI , I worry my eyelids will pull off because of the magnetic particles lol. It’s not funny but something to think about. Surely they would wash them off first. Don’t think about it. Try them. After all, beauty comes at a price lol.","title":"Excellent magnetic lashes!","timestamp":1620372579752}

(I once had an Essie polish like this called Ballet Slippers, which this is similar to.)

The glass is thick and, while it's certainly not immune to breaking, it can deal with the occasional bump without a problem.

This one is a medium weight oil that initially smells very lightly scented. It's a very \"cologne\" type scent which I really don't care for. I am more into the woodsy, tea tree, sandalwood type scents. At first smell, this beard oil had a very light scent however once applied, this scent lasts a very long time. This is where I had a hard time with it. I like to put my beard oil on in the morning and night after brushing my teeth and I was still able to smell this beard oil into the next morning, which might have been a good thing had I enjoyed the scent.

I love the look and style of the lashes I think they are like a soft glam look and not too overly dramatic. The lash band is lined with magnetic pieces which you can see if looked at closely not while wearing but prior to application. The magnetic eyeliner applicator is also something I truly like as it is a felt tip which isn't bendy or floppy. Its not so stiff you can't work with it but its not flimsy as in it would be hard to apply or even get a nice sharp wing with it. The one issue I do have with the magnetic eyeliner is it almost comes across as a glue adhesive and when I say that I don't mean like with glue you can reapply as much as you need to even if you mess up with this formula one coat and you can't go back over it because it will not only pick up pieces of the other product and it also doesn't layer well. However what I do mean is that if you apply the lashes and say you its not sticking to your inner corner and you have to remove some if not alot of the adhesive is def coming with it dry or not. Outside of the above mentioned problem I just had issues with it sticking to my inner corner but the lashes look absolutely beautiful on and I def love the style that's for sure. Its one of those things where I am not used to magnetic lashes and this is my first time trying them so its something I'm going to have to get used to. I will also say the adhesive was pretty easy to remove in which I used something similar to a makeup eraser. The only issues I had were the bits that stuck im my own lashes that I had to physically remove with my hands.","title":"Something I will have to continue to work with","timestamp":1622698447266}

{"user_id":"AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1","item_id":"B08R7BSGVH","rating":3,"review_text":"A while back I tried an adhesive eyeliner for the first time. I had never heard of it before, so I honestly thought it was going to just be a gimmicky product and not actually work. I figured if something like that actually worked, why hadn’t I heard of it already?! I mean, lash glue can be a pain to work with. To have an eyeliner and lash glue in one, that’s amazing! That seemed like something people would be raving about, but I hadn’t even heard such a thing existed. But, I figured I’d try it out. I’m glad I did! That one actually worked well. It did end up drying out fast, but it worked. So, since then, I have been trying out different ones.<br \/><br \/>This has a felt tip. The eyeliner is pigmented, very black. The adhesive is sticky, but not extremely sticky. You have to work pretty darn fast with this. I have really small, really hooded eyes. So, when I wear liner, I like to tight line my lash line. I don’t want to be taking up the tiny lid space that’s actually seen with black liner. In order to tightline with a really thin line like I like, I usually move pretty slowly. Unfortunately, I can’t do that with this liner. I have to move fast if I don’t want it to dry and lose its stickiness. But, even if I move fast, the thin line like I like doesn’t cut it. The liner doesn’t seem all that sticky. But, it can be....<br \/><br \/>I always want to test adhesive liners before applying them to my eye. I don’t know if I’ll have some sort of reaction, so I figure it’s better to be safe than sorry. So, I draw a little line of it in my forearm. While I’m doing that, I give the liner a little test to see how it works. I drew the little line on my forearm. Then, I took a lash and stuck it to that line. The lash stuck really well to the line. It stayed on it well, even when I gave it little tugs. After that, I was really excited to try it on my eyes! I didn’t have any sort of reaction to the liner, so it was time to try it on my eyes....<br \/><br \/>I drew a thin line on my eyes, grabbed the lash and went to apply it. It stuck great to the last part of the line I had just finished drawing, but wouldn’t stick to the area where I started drawing the line. I didn’t know why, so I wiped it off and tried again. The same thing happened. Then, I figured it probably dried quickly, so I needed to work faster. So, I had everything ready to go and drew the line quickly, then went to apply the lash. That time it stuck a little better and actually stuck to whole line, but it kept lifting. I finally got it figured out where it would stick well - I had to draw a thicker line and had to be quick. Unfortunately, I don’t like thick liner, so it just won’t work for me.<br \/><br \/>Overall, the liner works well if you’re able to work very fast and like thicker liner. I only like tight-lining my lashes with a very thin line, so this liner isn’t for me. But, like I said, if you don’t mind thick liner and are able to work fast drawing the line and getting the lashes stuck to it, this could work for you.","title":"Works okay if you can draw line fast and get lashes on it, and line has to be thick","timestamp":1624266847524}

Before getting it I was thinking it was going to be like regular soap but when you see it it’s anything but regular soap.  My roommate and I were both a bit confused thinking perhaps these were bath bombs because the look is similar to bath bombs more than it is to bar soap. I had to revisit the listing to double-check that it is meant to be used as soap.<br \/><br \/>Usage is interesting.  It does break down very quickly though it stays intact long enough to use as bar soap.  You just don’t get many washes out of each bar.  With water, it does suds up a good amount which I like.  It also gets a bit milky looking and the gritty texture does exfoliate too.<br \/><br \/>After using it I like the feeling of it on my skin.  My skin feels a little tingly, refreshed, and soft.  So it does work well for me as a soap but it just doesn’t last long.<br \/><br \/>The scent is not my favorite at all.  Some might enjoy the scent but it’s very strongly clove-scented.  It’s a bit too overbearing for my tastes. The scent also seems to last on my skin for a little longer than normal bar soap would.  If I was more fond of the scent this would be a good thing.<br \/><br \/>Overall it’s a decent product but it’s not really for me.  I just don’t love the scent and it’s a bit too different from normal bar soap for me.  I love the exfoliating ability of this soap.  That is the one area I really liked and I would buy this if I found a scent I enjoyed.  The price is reasonable given that you get 6 bars.  I would say they last maybe 1\/3rd to 1\/4th of the length of most bar soaps and that might be a stretch.","title":"Different from what I expected","timestamp":1606689176031}

Most tell you to put them on for 60-90 minutes. These only have you leave the foot masks on for 20-30 minutes. When we used these, we followed these directions. I'm not sure if they would have worked better if we'd left them on as long as we would with normal foot masks. Along with that, the directions say that if they aren't working as well as you'd like, you can use a new mask as soon as 4 days after the first mask. That seems really soon for me. Often, you aren't going to even begin seeing results until about four or five days after you first used the mask. Other brands suggest that you don't use another one for at least a month. That makes me think that these are not as powerful as other foot masks, which could be a good thing if you are concerned about your foot masks being too powerful.<br \/><br \/>One thing that surprised me about these masks was that there was no mention of soaking your feet daily after using the foot masks. Every other foot mask that I've used has included that in the instructions. I'm not sure how well these would work without soaking your feet since my family soaked our feet even though that was not part of the directions.<br \/><br \/>One thing that I liked about these was that they do smell really nice. They have a refreshing coconut scent. Some of the others that I've tried smell a bit chemically or like medicine. Unfortunately, I didn't feel like these worked as well as other foot masks. They are probably a 3.5-star item for me. They are less expensive than the other masks that I've tried, but they don't seem to work as well.

Pop this baby in the fridge on hot summer days as a way to take your skin from tired to taut. Warm it up to help your skin absorb products more easily. It washes clean and doesn't absorb any of the products. The trouble comes from how it's put together. The metal caps that hold the rollers on each end of the wand\/handle come off too easily. They aren't glued or crimped on, nor are the little metal caps snug fitting. Both ends where off when my roller arrived so I actually thought I had to assemble everything prior to each use. If I hold the roller up to where it's straight up and down, the roller that is facing the floor slides right off the handle. In a way this isn't a completely horrible thing since being able to disassemble the roller works better for travel.  Just please be careful when opening your storage bag and pulling out the roller in case yours is the same way. If it were to fall onto a hard enough surface from a high enough height, the rollers could crack or shatter.<br \/><br \/>Aside from the poor craftsmanship, I do enjoy using this roller and not only for applying skincare products. Sticking the roller in the freezer for 20 minutes then using it on my face and neck when I am suffering from a migraine is a godsend. I recommend having two so that you can use one to battle your headache while the other one cools down. The rollers hold cold (or heat) for several minutes, and can be wonderful tools to help relieve pain from stuffed up sinuses as well as headaches. The little gua sha tool that is included is also wonderful for more than applying skin care products. Chilling the gua sha before use can help treat puffy eyes, headaches, small bruises, mosquito bites, foot massages, and so on. Both this and the roller are completely smooth  - no rough edges or bumps.<br \/><br \/>Also included are a black velvet bag for storage, a handy booklet showing how to use both the roller and gua sha, and a hand written note thanking me for my purchase which is a really sweet gesture. All-in-all the tools are nice products, but for the price you'd think the manufacturers could afford glue to keep the rollers on the handle.","title":"Nice but could be made better","timestamp":1564352311635}

The glitter does really pop when applied over the black or just as a glitter polish.  This brand offers some excellent coloring.  Often glitter polish has a full look, this is rather vibrant.  I did also apply the glitter polish over other brands of gel and had no issues.  You need a base coat if you are applying the black (or other color) gel polish on your natural nails, but if you are applying the gel polish on your acrylic or polygel nails you can skip the base coat.<br \/><br \/>Overall this applies very easily, has standard set times using a UV\/LED Light.

This one however was great for my long thick wavy mess of a head of hair. It left my hair soft, manageable, and even a bit shinier than before. My hair felt hydrated without being weighted down, and wasn't left straw like which has happened to me in the past when I try to deep condition. I can usually go about 3-4 days between shampoos and didn't find myself needing to wash my hair any sooner than that. Obviously, if you shampoo more often on the regular you will have a different result than me. But basically it didn't leave my hair feeling dirty the next day.<br \/><br \/>My process: I shampooed and then like most masks and conditioners I kept it away from my roots and only applied it from the midshaft to my ends (otherwise I end up with oily roots). Then I waited... and waited... and waited. Since I was reviewing the product I wanted to make sure I waited the full 10 mins to give it a chance. I was out of stuff to wash and shave after about 3 min so the last 7 were pretty boring. In the future I will probably only wait 5 min. I didn't apply any other conditioner other than my normal heat protector I spritz onto towel dried hair. Blow-dried as usual and the results let me skip the flat iron.<br \/><br \/>I was pretty please. I find this an easy mask to recommend. I have spent much more and gotten less of a result.

They are very similar in style to all the other dermaplaning razors out there, but they are longer than any I have used. The blade is just a hair under 2\". Pun intended. One of the popular blades among beauty conscious people (pictured) is around 1.5\". Many are 1\" or less. SO, keep this in mind for where you want to use this and if you are comfortable with that length of blade. Otherwise it is all very similar.<br \/><br \/>I like that this 5 pack is contained within a box. Many are on a flat piece of cardboard with molded plastic around them. Makes it too easy to lose one, misplace one.. they just fall out of package when opened. This box will nicely store the remainder. I won't lose these among my other beauty goodies.<br \/><br \/>I have no idea what it says on the box. The sticker on the box says Made in China. The box says, Made in Japan. I can't read anything else.<br \/><br \/>Handle is short- I think adds to precision of use. The longer blade makes it harder to get the eyebrow area. For that, I would go with a smaller, angled razor. For larger areas of face (or other body areas), this large blade is nice. As with any blade, BE CAREFUL. And don't over use it- a dull blade can be as dangerous and damaging as a sharp blade.<br \/><br \/>The blade is indeed sharp. I usually use a regular razor (like for shaving legs) to shave my face. I have pale skin and dark hair, so I have always preferred to just shave off my hair. No, it doesn't grow back thicker or darker. But it sure makes the face nice and smooth- great for make up looking good, for skin care setting in nicely, for exfoliation- for overall health of skin. A leg razor is fine, less likely to cut.. but a straight razor provides an extra close shave (if careful). I love these for taking care of upper lip area, and for eyebrow area.. but is taking some getting used to since it is a longer blade than others I use.","title":"sharp, long plade, short handle, slices hair off easily","timestamp":1561224373116}

{"user_id":"AHNIWV6SX76RSYNUAUSFLYFEWQRA","item_id":"B08JD6VZK4","rating":5,"review_text":"Much of the hand sanitizer we have been using is ETHYL alcohol (ethanol) based.  THIS sanitizer is ISOPROPYL alcohol based.  Note that historically most hand sanitizer has been based on isopropyl alcohol whereas ethanol has been used in things like alcohol that you drink of as a gasoline additive for oxygenated fuels (for environmental purposes) as well as other purposes.  Isopropyl has been used in hand sanitizer and \"rubbing alcohol\" among other things.  Both are now approved for use in hand sanitizer.  Ethynol-based sanitzers are becoming much more common due to high demand and supply constraints on Isopropyl-based sanitizers.<br \/><br \/>The interesting thing is that the CDC and WHO have different guidelines for hand sanitizer effectiveness for these two types of alcohol:<br \/>CDC: Ethyl - at least 60%, Isopropyl - at least 70%<br \/>WHO: Ethyl - at least 80%, Isopropyl - at least 75%<br \/>You can see that it is interesting that the CDC recommends higher concentrations of Isopropyl whereas WHO recommends higher concentrations of Ethyl.  Curious.  Rather than dig into too many details on the difference, the easiest thing is to find a way to meet both...<br \/><br \/>The most common ethyl alcohol hand sanitizers that we have been getting (and the most common out there) are 70% -- which exceeds CDC 60% threshold, but is below the 80% WHO threshold.<br \/><br \/>THIS SANITIZER has an ISOPROPYL concentration of 75% which exceeds the CDC 70% threshold and meets the WHO 75% threshold.<br \/><br \/>Clearly these thresholds are not hard limits as indicated by the difference of opinion between CDC and WHO, but it is mildly comforting to meet both recommendations if you can do so with no downside or extra expense.<br \/><br \/>WHAT I LIKE:<br \/>* Easily squeezes out of bottle in controlled amount as a gel<br \/>* Rubs in easily and absorbs within less than a minute to leave no noticeable residue or tackiness on your hands<br \/>* Aloe helps to keep your hands moist, fighting the drying effects of the alcohol<br \/>* Small bottles are easy to take in car, backpack, purse, etc.<br \/>* Scent is minor and dissipates quickly (we're not using this for its smell after all)<br \/><br \/>SUMMARY:<br \/>A cost effective way to keep you hands sanitized when you can't use soap & water.

I have quite a collection of makeup brushes, however I didn't have a eyebrow brush. Most of the time I would just use whatever brush I could find to do my brows. Since using this kit, my brows look a million times better!<br \/><br \/>The angled brush is the perfect width for brows. I use this with a brow powder, and it makes placing the product so easy, and you can manipulate the brush to create the illusion of eye brow hair. The brush is just overall fantastic. On the opposite end there is a spoolie. I like to use this in between swipes with the brush. I can brush out my brows, apply some product, and brush them out again. This gives my brows a very natural look, without taking away the product I just applied. It also softens them so they don't look harsh. Love it.<br \/><br \/>The next piece in the kit is the eye lash comb and brow brush. I use the eye lash brush after applying mascara and letting it dry. This will remove any clumps that your mascara may have left, and fans out your lashes to look fuller and just amazing! The brow brush I use more often when I am using an eyebrow wax. Once I apply the wax, I can use this brush to create a more natural look. Again, it's fantastic!<br \/><br \/>I really like this kit. It is a staple in my collection, and gets used daily. I love the packaging this comes in, if you need to travel, this is perfect! Place your brushes in the cylinder and they will be perfectly protected! 5 stars all around for this kit!<br \/><br \/>*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.","title":"Such A Great Kit!","timestamp":1412014862000}

I wished there was an additional silicone anti-leak flap where the product comes out (like on certain ketchup or honey bottles) so the more liquidy contents doesn't flow right out when you open the cap.

Keep in mind that this is glass, not plastic. There are inherent advantages to using glass, such are durability and environmental concerns. Also, glass will not chemically interact with most liquids (however, caution is still necessary since the spray top and mechanism is composed of plastic). The disadvantage is that this kind of glass bottle is heavier than comparative plastic bottles. The amber color protects the contents from light (sunlight and uv exposure). My view is this type of spray bottle is more on the premium end of the scale.<br \/>Included accessories: 4 regular screw on tops, 1 screw on eye dropper top, funnel, labels and marker. Each of the bottles comes with the plastic spray top already installed. I appreciate the regular tops, which effect a better seal than the spray tops, which will protect the contents from spills, evaporation and contaminants. I wish they provided at least 2 of the eye dropper tops, but I guess even getting one, when the the product is sold as spray bottles, is a bonus.<br \/>The sprayer mechanism can actually rotate, it's not a one piece sprayer top, the screw on segment is separate from the spraying segment.

Plus the massage roller seemed to have a roller that was larger than usual. I was thus prepared to have this product exceed my expectations.<br \/>The roller has good quality materials, with decent manufacture. I am a bit dismayed because the rollers seem to interact directly with the golden tone metal arms. Most credible massage rollers have a 'buffer' , like a gasket, that minimizes the stone from rolling against the bare metal. This is important because direct contact will eventually take a toll on either part. The rollers on this tool more freely, but keep in mind that the stone is rolling against the metal rod. Add pressure and you have a circumstance wherein friction will gradually erode either of both contact surfaces. This issue is little noticed, unless you have some experience with this type of massage device.<br \/>The gua sha jade stone, also with the striking green hue, unfortunately had a number of issues.

All 10 spray bottles included all the necessary parts, and the stem that draws up liquid was long in each one, none were short and I really appreciated that. You should be able to spray down to the last drop.  I tested mine with rubbing alcohol, for sanitizing my phones. The funnel came in handy for filling the bottle. It made the job so easy! The sprayer does spray a very fine mist. I used it several times to clean some things then left it overnight with the cap on. Next day I tested it again. First off, the cap contained some of the rubbing alcohol inside it, which means the container will leak into the cap standing up. Not necessarily a huge deal breaker, but a negative for me. Holding it in my hand I got the rubbing alcohol on my finger too, so this may waste product just from this. Several drops every 24 hours may not seem like a lot, but if you make your own essential oil room spray then this could be an expensive waste. Lastly, I had an issue with the spray top, the angle is so slight I wasn't sure if I would spray myself in the face of I wasn't wearing eyeglasses. You have to be careful, ensuring you're spraying away from yourself. I did not get any leakage of the alcohol out of the cap, it seemed pretty tight.  It did pool in the cap, didn't run down the bottle.  I did get a rubbing alcohol ring when I set down the cap on my coffee table tho.  Beware of that possibility whatever you use in these bottles.<br \/>All in all, a nice kit and I give it 4 stars.","title":"I got leaking inside the cap, but it didn't come out.","timestamp":1596033276005}

Tempt by Cazbe Skin Care Products Rejuvenate your youthful glow]]<br \/><br \/>I am always looking for something that will help me turn back the hands of time. I want to look good for as long as I can and because of that I've often used Vitamin C serums. I know they are effective and help with aging skin a lot,  My skin has always been a challenge. I have oily skin with large pores and sometimes have uneven and dull skin. I also have some expression lines on my forehead. I wanted to start using this serum as soon as I got it home. The serum comes in a very nice bottle which I like a lot because not only is it pretty but the serum is delivered in an airless pump which distributes exactly the right amount of serum to my fingertips for easy application to my face. Since Vitamin C products are easily oxidized I appreciate the product being dispensed this way so that it protects the serum and keeps it effective. I have been using this serum the morning on cleansed skin after toner, and then again at night before moisturizer on clean skin in the same way. The serum has a nice scent that is not overpowering and it only takes a pump or two of the serum to cover my entire face. The serum doesn't feel greasy or oily and it's just the right consistency to spread easily. There was no burning or irritation with this product, and it absorbs well into my skin with no left over residue. My skin feels smooth, silky and refreshed after I apply this serum as if my face has a refreshing blast of moisture. It looks supple and moisturized for hours and I've noticed my makeup stays on better. I have been using the serum for about two weeks now. Since then I have noticed a lot of amount of improvement in the tone and smoothness of my skin. It doesn't look as dull  and my skin also looks firmer. My skin is more radiant and soft and the expression lines in my forehead appear a little softer and the improved clarity of my skin is noticeable. My skin also looks better when I'm not wearing makeup. My skin has improved a little and I've been asked what had I been doing to make my skin look better? That makes me feel more confident that the serum is working. I am going to continue to use this serum and consider it a good value worth every penny of the asking price here since a little goes a long way.","title":"Anti Aging Serum - The Best Hyaluronic Acid Face Cream Moisturizer","timestamp":1467494684000}

I was super skeptical as I was doing my sisters nails. She has much more elegant hands and long nails so hence why she was my model for trying this gel kit. The instructions are clear and explain what is used for what and how to use them in the proper steps. The instructions also come with tips which were helpful. You get a UV light, a buffer and pads, topcoat, peel off base coat, two colors, prep it and end it solution. The UV light is a plug in and not battery operated. It is a bit of a time-consuming process – it took me about an hour to do my sisters nails. I love the gray that comes in this set, but the pink leaves a bit to be desired. The gray applies beautifully and isn’t translucent unlike the pink. The pink was still translucent even after two coats. The instructions state to cure it for 45 seconds (well this is how long the UV light stays on) but her nails were still sticky. So, I cured them several more times and they remained sticky. I finally decided to just finish them with the topcoat. I cured them then the instructions stated to take a pad with the end it solution and rub her nails to rid the tacky coating. I was super nervous about this step and was worried that all my work and her patience would’ve been for nothing. After wiping her nails, I didn’t see any polish transfer or dents on her nails.  Which I had let out a sigh of relief. I suppose they’re tacky because of the sort of polish this is and didn’t need to cure it as much as I did. This was my first time doing anything like this, but I think her nails turned out nice. I’m sure with practice, I’ll get even better. I really love that you can get salon nails from the comfort of your own home. I also believe this kit is well worth the money.

Recently I began bleaching the dye out of my hair to go natural rather than let it grow out; I've been using argan oil very happily as a moisturizing treatment. I thought the Jack Black Epic Moisture would be a great comparison item against the argan, but it hasn't been. Sure, it temporarily smooths your hair. It makes the ends stick together a little bit after you use a flat iron. But as soon as I wash my hair, it feels the same as it did before. The oil isn't imparting any lasting benefit to my hair. I have thick, curly hair for the record.<br \/><br \/>Yes, it makes my hands and elbows smooth(er) temporarily. But I have to keep applying it.

On the plus side this did not aggravate my rosacea and didn't cause any zits to form.<br \/><br \/>They suggest a use for a beard conditioner\/softener; I'd never thought of that use but have to wonder if a man would enjoy this fragrance lingering near his nose\/mouth throughout the day.<br \/><br \/>This SMELLS great.

It's not what I needed and I wouldn't buy it, but I know there are a lot of men and women who need just this light kind of oil and would find it beneficial.

{"user_id":"AH5PGJYVXBFVRXAFSTA7AEH4EXRQ","item_id":"B08R6QX4Y9","rating":4,"review_text":"I've been using extensions since 2006, due to health issues causing extreme hair thinning.  I used to get the fused extensions at the salon, 1500 dollars back in the day. They broke off from the weight of the extensions because my hair was so fine and thin. The fused glob of hair was just too much and so many fell out. I started buying the clip in hair, taking the clips off and using them as weft hair. I use salon pro white glue, much like eyelash glue but used for weft hair.  It is a wonderful solution and I still alternate between tape in hair and the clip in wefts. I also buy closures and custom color, to make my own toppers. What a job! But, I'm happy with the results. I have more control over the color and style, and I feel 'normal'.<br \/><br \/>This hair is a medium to coarse texture, thick, and has a really nice body wave. The  is soft and smooth and doesn't feel damaged.  It will blend with fine hair. You can use a straightening iron, just be sure that you can control the temperature. Once you burn this hair, it will stink and it will be ruined. However, if you control the temperature and use care, the hair looks great straight and shiny. You can also curl the hair. I have used felted hot rollers, and those work really well. They are safer, and not as damaging, and the curls last so long.<br \/><br \/>These 16\" extensions are very nice. Although the ad isn't quite accurate. The color is a darker caramel blond, and a reddish brown. This is not piano keys, but close. The wefts are not in the ombre style, they are bold and varied high lights. If you look at the ad images, the photos showing the people aren't shown with this product in their hair. The wefts laying on a surface showing the color differences between the offered colors is the most accurate.  I've offered some images that show the color more accurately.  You can custom color most of the wefted hair, but adding color is easier. Typically the hair has so much red in it that it is impossible to cover or remove, and the dye can be hard to remove. You can add a longer root to eliminate the chunky roots.  My hair is so fine, the sewn edge can be obvious, so have a good match to my natural blonde ash tone roots helps. Any coloring will add to the damage and potentially shorten the life of the hair, but for me it makes me happier to have an exact match to what I want, and I am hard to match for color.<br \/><br \/>The weight of the hair is shown in a photo in ounces. In grams, we get a little over 104 grams, far less than the advertised 120grams, and I would complain about this and have, just not for this brand.  That being said, the fullness and the weight is still good, and the wefts seem to feel average when compared to what I usually order. If you order the longer options, the hair will be thinner, as most hair is sold by weight. 120 would be better, of course. This weight is significantly lower than 120grams.<br \/><br \/>Shedding.  Over the last 7 years or so, shedding has become a real problem. It never used to be this bad. There is a weft glue that is meant to slow or prevent shedding and I always use it. It makes the weft more stiff, but if you use the weft the way I use them, you need to do something to protect your weft hair.  You can find it online. If you are using this hair for special occasions and clipping  to thick strong hair and are simply making your hair more full, wild and glamorous, then you may not need to worry about shedding. I did finger comb this hair once out of the packaging, and there was significant shedding. Again, I say, this is a common issue now, and unique to this particular brand. I have no idea what changed but the wefts should not shed this much, but they all do this with most brands.  I have to say that if the wefts didn't shed so much, they would last for a couple of years or longer.  Also, keep in mind I use the wefts differently, so clipping, as intended, may offer longer life and far less shedding.<br \/><br \/>The length is 16\" and the hair hangs nicely, with a gentle, natural taper.  There is a very nice body wave. It's not a blunt edge finish, which is nice.<br \/><br \/>The clips are the same type that I see on most clip in kits. They are small, and hold nicely even on fine hair.<br \/><br \/>Over all, I think this is a great value and will require the extra effort to keep them looking great over a year or more.  To keep human hair looking good and tangle free, I use the sleep and shine shampoo and conditioner. It keeps the hair fresher and mat free longer.  There are a lot  of youtube videos that can help you with application and care, and give you tips and tricks.<br \/><br \/>4 stars.","title":"Pretty nice quality hair for the price.","timestamp":1618218516591}

I love the idea of a hand held irrigator and this does work to remove most stuck debris from between the teeth. What is nice about this one over the other handheld I tried, is that there is very little splash back. However, I personally do not like that the reservoir is not removable for drying.<br \/><br \/>IN THE PACKAGE<br \/>- One reservoir attached to handheld flosser unit<br \/>- One USB cable (wall adapter NOT included)<br \/>- One instruction manual<br \/>- One standard jet nozzle<br \/>- One orthodontic nozzle (larger brush)<br \/>- One pocket nozzle (smaller brush)<br \/>- One tong scraping nozzle (what looks like a spoon)<br \/><br \/>I charged the unit fully before use. The white light on the side blinks when charging and remains steady when it is fully charged. Note the charging port is hidden behind a silicone nub below the grip dots on the top of the unit. Be careful to cover the charging port with this nub when the flosser is in use.<br \/><br \/>There is an on\/off switch and a mode switch. The three water pressure modes are soft, standard, and massage can be cycled through using the mode switch prior to turning the unit on. The jet tip (or any of the other three tips) gets inserted into the top. Be careful to make sure it is seated with the notch in the groove as the first time I put it in the hole, I did not have it seated all the way. To eject, press the release button to the left side.<br \/><br \/>The reservoir IS NOT removable. Instead water enters through the small opening on bottom through which one has to fill the unit. I do not like that the reservoir is attached as I have to drain the remaining water out of that hole and leave the door open for drying. Also, the little button through which the water enters can easily break after lots of use. I personally would prefer not to have to use that hole.<br \/><br \/>I held my mouth almost totally closed during use and tried all three modes. I did not have splash back, which was very nice. Splash back is usually typical of almost any type of water flosser so to some extent I was surprised. This flosser does work to dislodge most debris between teeth but not everything because it is not super powerful but is powerful enough. I am also impressed that the manual is relatively well written; kudos to the manufacturer on this. Normally, I feel as if I am reading Pig Latin when I receive products from China or other countries.<br \/><br \/>In summary, my biggest disappointment with this unit is the attached reservoir that prevents me from drying this out easily.","title":"Relatively strong water flosser but reservoir is attached which makes drying it nearly impossible","timestamp":1556243557316}

This probably provides moderate hydration for normal skin, but for me it feels quite lightweight.

This seems best for those who don’t need heavy hydration and enjoy a lavender scent.<br \/><br \/>This lotion does have a moderately strong lavender scent that even lingers on my hands after washing. It smells nice and doesn’t bother me, but it may bother those sensitive to fragrance as this is just in the range of what I can tolerate as strong lavender has been a headache trigger for me.

That being said, because she actually does love and trusts the brand she decided to give it a go. She found their hair ties about 2 years ago and hasn’t looked back since. As a new mom who never previously had her hair up she was always looking for something that would properly hold ALL of her hair up and back out of her way. She really liked these because not only did they do that, but as long as she didn’t tie her hair too tight they generally didn’t leave lines in her hair after use either. She usually uses the thick type hair back and finds that unlike other brands these don’t get knotted up in her hair even being silicone\/plastic material. However, even with her trust in the brand, she wasn’t totally sure this would work. Her first go with this wasn’t successful, but she tried again and was able to get it in. She was shocked how well one\/two tests held up all her hair so well. She tried it in our daughter's hair and had the same hard time holding the hair all together while trying to wrap and twist the device.

Although the box is in English, and has clear instructions and ingredients, the product itself lacks those things. Celimax comes in a streamlined bottle that looks like mineral water. Aside from the general disaster that could pose with small children, the FDA requires cosmetic products sold in the USA list their ingredients on the bottle in English.<br \/><br \/>The ingredients, by the way, which I wish Amazon would leave a spot for cosmetic vendors to include in their listings, so we would know before we order in case of allergies, are Sedum Sarmentosum, Butylene Glycol, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide NP, Xylityglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Dipotassium Glycrrhizate, Citrus Tangerina Peel Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, Glucose, Phospholifpids, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Caprylic\/Capric Triclyceride, Ammonium Acryloylidimethyltaurate\/VP Copolymer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-13 Pareth-9, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin.<br \/><br \/>Having said that, I poured a little bit of the product onto a cotton pad in the evening and dabbed it onto my face, and onto the back of my hands.

Anything cosmetic that has perfume (think lip smackers) or added scent has the potential to make me nauseous and bring on a migraine.

It is talc free, cruelty free, and vegan.<br \/><br \/>This has a very simple ingredient list - Corn starch modified, distarch phosphate, silica. I liked that.<br \/><br \/>It comes in simple packaging - It says it is sustainable packaging. It is an amber colored glass bottom (at least it seems like glass). It is thick, so seems durable. The top seems like tin. Mine was dented when I got it. Not sure how but it just came that way. The top twists off. Inside there is a plastic piece with 4 holes in it. There’s a sticker covering the holes that you remove. I like that it only has 4 holes. Loose powders can be so messy and I store mine in a drawer, but sometimes they get knocked over in the drawer and the powder goes into the cap and when I remove the cap I have to be careful not to get it everywhere. Because of that, I’ll usually only uncover like 3 of the holes on a loose powder. It means less powder getting out into the cap if it tips over. But, with this only having 4 holes I didn’t feel the need to do that.<br \/><br \/>The powder is finely milled. It feels silky and smooth. It is white. It goes on mostly transparent. I’m really pale and was surprised that this made me look a little paler when I first applied it. I ended up going over where I applied the powder with a clean brush to get any excess off and that removed the pale look. So, the next time I used it, I used a damp sponge. I picked some up on the sponge, dabbed it off on the back of my hand to spread out the powder and get off excess, and then pressed it into my skin. That worked much better. It left my makeup set and smooth, without looking pale at all. It doesn’t feel or look dry or cakey. It gives a nice smooth, matte finish to the skin, but not too matte. I have normal to dry skin, more on the dry side with some extremely dry areas. So, I only powder where I have to. This doesn’t make my dry areas look or feel any drier and doesn’t accentuate them either.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I really like this powder. It keeps my makeup looking nice all day. I don’t have breakthrough sweat or oils coming through it. I work 12 hour shifts and I’m on my feet running around for a lot of that time, so I often sweat. A lot of powders I’ll end up sweating through and needing to touch up throughout the day. I didn’t feel the need to do that with this. I really like it a lot. When I first saw how pale it made me after applying it the first time, I thought I was going to end up hating this. But, I’m glad I dusted off the excess and tried a different way of applying it the next time. Both ways work, but the damp sponge definitely is the best way I found for me.

The product is similar to Micellar Cleansing Water and works well as a cleanser. With a few drops on my cotton pad, I was able to remove my make-up with no residue. Be careful when you dab the water onto the cotton pad as it can pour out. Though the product is described as a no-rinse cleanser, I would recommed washing your face after using the cleansing water. I worked out after removing my make-up with the cleanser but the product got in my eyes and it irritated them like when soap gets in your eyes. It's a good product for make-up removal but not enough to change my cleansing routine.","title":"Cleanser for Make-up Removal","timestamp":1596769782161}

While I prefer the closeness of a razor a cordless shaver does save time and money. The Arcitec 1090 is Norelco's high-end cordless shaver that has oodles of features.<br \/><br \/>Likes-<br \/><br \/>- Time display showing remaining battery life.<br \/>- Ease of cleaning the heads after use<br \/>- Suction cups on the base to hold the unit firm to counter-top<br \/>- Nick-free shaving<br \/>- The charging pod makes an ideal traveling case<br \/><br \/>Needed Improvements and\/or dislikes-<br \/>- Not the closest shave - after shaving my face feels similar to what it is like 12 hours after using a razor<br \/>- Not sure why there is such a large cost difference between the Arctitec 1090 and the 1050. The 1090 has a time display and the charging pod, but I have hard time seeing that as to justifying the cost difference.<br \/>- Not sure if this product is actually an upgrade from the older \"Lift-and-Cut\" technology they previously advertised. My impression is that the new shave is about a wash with the old one.<br \/><br \/>Final Summary- While I enjoy the ease and comfort of the Norelco Arcitec 1090 I am not sure if the added features make it worth the additional cost over the 1050 - and thus costing it one star. However, as a whole I have no problems giving the product a hearty endorsement!","title":"Nice Shave...but beter than a razor?","timestamp":1197136923000}

Once using this product, it little comes off like little toilet paper rolls (I know gross). I usually use them on my husbands back. These are great to use before shaving to avoid getting ingrown hairs. I also use these once a week before applying self tanner. I use these after I have been in the shower for a few minutes and my skin has softened. Great product!","title":"Seriously cannot live without these","timestamp":1627505766635}

I prefer to use the micro needle roller first. It isn’t the most comfortable feeling, but you get use to it. I do it while I am watching T.V. To distract myself. While rolling, I put the jade roller in the refrigerator. Once I finish with the micro needle, I apply hyaluronic acid, and then roll with the jade roller. It is SO SOOTHING. The roller has two sides- a large end for the planes of your face, and a small end to get in smaller areas like under your eyes. I only use the micro needle roller once a week-usually on Saturday nights. It does make your face a little red, but it goes away by morning. I use the jade roller a couple times a week, especially after stressful days. Just so you know, make sure to sterilize both rollers or you will have major breakouts from spreading bacteria around. I keep alcohol in a small spritzer to use on both before each use. The  packaging was sufficient, and I would feel comfortable giving it as a gift.","title":"Great starter set!","timestamp":1609556584722}

I feel like using the eyelash brush is way better and applies more evenly than anything else and I'm able to get my lashes from the root to the end of the lash with the serum. Be careful though because I low key poked myself with the brush in both eyes once lol. I've noticed growth since using this eyelash serum and I've been using it for the past 2 weeks twice a day. I also like how I'm killing two birds with one stone by using the serum and also curling my lashes at the same time. I've used it with my contacts on and had not problems with the serum or brush.","title":"Love it, growth and curling at the same time.","timestamp":1607219001039}
