At first, my wife thought that these are small and thin, but she found that one was sufficient to remove makeup and mascara, with mascara top coat (which can be challenging to remove with other wipes).  My wife has tried several brands before, including top-rated wipes, and all of them except for this one irritates her skin slightly.  These do not!  Her skin is pretty tough, and she doesn't usually have reactions to cosmetics.<br \/><br \/>There is a label on the inner package with Japanese writing, that's not translated into English on the package.  It says to make sure to use the plastic box to store the wipes to ensure quality and peel off the sticker completely; don't remove the wipes from the bag; make sure to close the lid after use.  I'd suggest that the manufacturer add a translated version on the package.  The package says to use the entire package within 45 days after opening, so if you don't wear make-up every day, you may not finish the package before they start to dry out.<br \/><br \/>My wife loves these!

It works quickly and well on Sally Hansen regular, non-gel nail polish (the only one I’ve tested it with so far). For the record, I have wimpy, prone to peel and\/or snap off, pathetically weak fingernails that get worse when I use acetone on them. This remover was surprisingly good, although I don’t think it’s natural at all.<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>• It took off three layers in a matter of seconds and left what seemed to be an oil residue that wiped off easily.<br \/>• I immediately applied fingernail polish again, and it applied and stayed on perfectly, even though my fingernails had just been oily from the remover.<br \/>• The dispenser worked really well, although I had to be careful to not push too hard. Just a light push gave me enough remover.<br \/>• The remover didn’t seem to damage or dry my nails in any way; it actually left my nails seeming moisturized or refreshed. Acetone, on the other hand, definitely dries my nails and makes them brittle.<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>This polish remover is not a natural product. It’s still a chemical soup. Maybe it has a more natural beginning (I’d like to see them explain it), but the ingredients require a degree in chemistry to divine their origins:<br \/><br \/>Ingredients: methyl acetate, isopropyl mistrate, and natural fragrance.<br \/><br \/>Frankly, I love that it works so well and doesn’t damage my nails. I just wish manufacturers wouldn’t put “natural” (or “plant therapy”) on products that aren’t. Subtracting one star for that misleading marketing strategy.<br \/><br \/>Overall, very, very pleased with this Plant Therapy Natural Acetone Free Nail Polish Remover so far.

One might think the wattage low on light but consider, it is also an LED light so they are more powerful. I still prefer a higher wattage. But even after doing any nails, they are a tad tacky. This is because with gel polish, one must take a wipe or cotton ball with your acetone, or I prefer alcohol. And wipe over nails gently. This is the very last step after top coat and curing.

The dark blue is our favorite color and we love that you can get the deep color with great glitter and shine using just one coat, on top of the base coat.  There are no base or top coats included, but as long as you have them, the set, along with a nail clipper and file is all you need to have salon quality manicure and pedicure.  The magnet included with the kit is rectangular, as shown, and is effective at making long streaks on the nails.  With some practice, you’ll be able to create very defined cat eyes, but make sure you keep the cure lights right nearby, or you’ll lose the streaking.  Additionally, make sure that you buff the nails lightly, clean the nails thoroughly, and run full cure times if you want to have the nail polish last more than two weeks.  Following this simple procedure will hopefully give you a high quality and long lasting finish like I have experienced.

No way she could wear it to school.<br \/><br \/>The concept is good.  You put your hair through the middle, start wrapping by twisting in 2 directions, and tie it off.  The problem is, you can't do this by yourself and make a nice bun.  It would be ok for a beach day or if you like a messy loose bun, but you can do that with a scrunchie much easier.<br \/><br \/>I would say save your money and your sanity and just pass on this.  Too bad, it looked cute.<br \/><br \/>Hope you found this review helpful!","title":"Does Not Work, Just a Mess","timestamp":1627657320824}

To me, it smells a lot like fruit punch (Hawaiian Punch, to be exact). You can smell it from the outside of the bottle as soon as it arrives. But don't smell it straight from the bottle, or on your cotton round... the solvents themselves have a very strong odor! After you use the product though, the only thing lingering is the fruit punch scent on your fingertips. There is a little bit of an oily residue left behind, but it beats the ashy dryness of straight acetone.<br \/><br \/>The leak-proof pump bottle works amazing! If you knock the bottle over, it does not spill. I love that! The cap on the bottle flips up to reveal the pump dispenser, which you press down to pull your liquid to the top. I did not have any issues during shipment, so I think this bottle will be fabulous for travel. This acetone-free formula removes traditional crème & shimmer polishes with little effort. The solvent base contains Ethyl Acetate & Isopropyl Mistrate. I wouldn't use this as my first defense against removing glitter lacquers, and I wouldn't use it to soak off gel polish at all. (Pure acetone is best for both of those options).<br \/><br \/>Plant Therapy products are proudly made in the USA! 🇺🇸","title":"Smells like Hawaiian Punch 😋 Great formula and I love the no-spill pump bottle!","timestamp":1617149633253}

After two squeezes. You get three little dots on the brush with each squeeze, brush those on with the applicator, and wow.<br \/><br \/>Having said that, it is a primer - so it doesn't provide all over color.

{"user_id":"AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1","item_id":"B0B4MR9BXN","rating":3,"review_text":"This comes in a nice outer product box. Made in Korea. The brand’s website said it’s 100% vegan, excluding animal ingredients and animal experiments. It also doesn’t include parabens.<br \/><br \/>It comes in a nice compact. It’s a compact like a cushion foundation where you open it and there’s a kind of lid that holds the sponge applicator, and you lift that lid to reveal the product. You press the applicator sponge into it (or your own sponge or brush) and then apply it. The brand’s website said the included sponge applicator is an “eco puff” made of “eco-friendly corns” and is “99.9% anti-bacterial and water-repellent,” which makes it safe on skin and keeps puff clean.<br \/><br \/>This is a liquidy but balm kind of texture. It isn’t as thick as a balm. It just feels like a cushion foundation. But this isn’t a foundation. It has a very light, mint green color to it. It’s so light that it’s almost white but has the green color to it. When applied, it reduces redness. It doesn’t do as well as my more pigmented green correctors, but it does a nice job while being hydrating and lightweight on the skin. It’s something that works well before applying foundation. It is lightweight enough to wear well under foundation. It isn’t a primer really, it doesn’t smooth out the skin or fill in pores. But, it does reduce the redness in my skin so then I use less foundation and concealer. If you have a TON of redness or it’s REALLY red, this might not be enough since it isn’t extremely pigmented. But, it will make a difference. I like it isn’t drying on the skin either.<br \/><br \/>I’m just not sure how I feel about it though. It works well on the skin. But, I do like to know what’s in my products. I don’t like that they provided barely any product info, and the ingredients on the product box weren’t in English. They also didn’t include them here on the product page. Not even the product photos provided any real info on the product - what it does, who it’s for, how to use it, ingredients, etc. I had to go to the brand’s website to find out more. Yes, it’s a simple Google search, but it’s not really something you  should have to do.<br \/><br \/>Normally, I would just go to the brand’s website to find the list of ingredients when they’re not included on the Amazon product page. But, the Jung Saem Mool website didn’t have them on their website either. I looked for them elsewhere and did find an ingredient list on Korean Beauty Box, but didn’t think they were accurate because they didn’t include centella asiatica, pine sprout, or green calamine powder, which are supposed to be in this product. So, I translated the ingredients from the box myself. But, I’m not that confident in the ingredients provided on the box.(I included a photo from the box, and also included the ingredients at the end of my review in English)<br \/><br \/>It doesn’t seem like a complete list of ingredients to me. It has the first ingredient as titanium dioxide. It has tocopherol (vitamin E) as the 3rd ingredient. The rest of the ingredient are 7, kind of versions I’d guess you’d call them, of centella asiatica. There’s nothing else listed. It’s kind of odd. The brand’s website said this is supposed to have “2 plants - pine sprout containing fresh moisture and centella asiatica roots.” I saw the “centella asiatica roots” in the ingredients when I translated them. But didn’t see any “pine sprout.” I also saw something about “cica pine water” on the brand’s website, but again, not sure what that’s supposed to be? The brand’s website also mentioned “Natural green calamine powder covers reddened skin tone.” Again, I didn’t see any calamine powder at all in the ingredients.<br \/><br \/>The 7, I guess versions, of Centella Asiatica are:<br \/>Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm) - Well known soothing, antioxidant, and moisturizing ingredient. Anti-inflammatory. The main biologically active components are Asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid. All of which are in this.<br \/><br \/>Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm)<br \/><br \/>Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm)<br \/><br \/>Madecassoside (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br \/><br \/>Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br \/><br \/>Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br \/><br \/>Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica. It’s less prominent than it’s sister component, Asiaticoside, but it still contributes to the well-established moisturizing and wound healing abilities of Centella Asiatica.<br \/><br \/>Overall, it works well. It reduces my redness, feels hydrating on the skin, and works well on its own and under foundation. It feels lightweight on the skin. If they provided the full ingredient list, it would be something I’d be willing to purchase. But, right now, I don’t like they didn’t include them and don’t like that they can’t even be found online as far as I could tell. And I just have a hard time believing the ingredient list I translated from the box is the full ingredient list. I don’t know. If the ingredients aren’t a big factor for you, this is nice and works well. If knowing the ingredients are important to you, I’d look elsewhere. There’s other similar products that actually provide a full ingredient list, and a lot of them are far cheaper. I give it 3 stars.<br \/><br \/>How to Use (from brand’s website):<br \/>Use as last step of skin care routine. Dip puff into content and gently apply and dab on skin.<br \/><br \/>Special Tips (from brand’s website)<br \/>Carry it in makeup bag or purse for easy supply of moisture to skin when it dries up.<br \/>Use as lightweight skin tone corrector to correct sensitive skin tone covered by masks instead of applying heavy, caking makeup.<br \/><br \/>FULL INGREDIENTS<br \/>Ingredients | Titanium dioxide (CI 77891], Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm), Tocopherol, Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm), Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm), Madecassoside (0.0025ppm), Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm), Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm), Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm)<br \/><br \/>**NOTE: Just for reference, 1ppm = 0.0001% (or 10,000 ppm = 1%).

It works great on my chin and forehead to reduce pores but I have some enlarged pores on my nose that it doesn’t touch.<br \/><br \/>I’ve used other primers that work slightly better but at a MUCH higher cost so I save them for going out vs every day.

I don't feel that this mask is drying, but it does leave you very clean.<br \/><br \/>So, in my opinion, this is good for all skin types, as long as you use it as a brightening mask as opposed to a hydrating mask.<br \/>This is just what your skin needs if you have overdosed on hot humid weather.please look at the ingredients to see if you have any sort of allergy or if any of them are a trigger for any skin issues. Because I have sensitive skin that can be triggered, but I only left it on for about 4 minutes. I had absolutely no irritation, but I think if I had left it on longer, I might have. That doesn't mean it's bad for you. If you leave a mild castile soap, which is so gentle, on your face for any length of time, skin will be irritated.<br \/>Made in the USA, from Tonica Skin in Marblehead Massachusetts.<br \/><br \/>I hope this review has helped you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to try this fun mask. It really does leave your skin feeling and looking energized, but it's a bit of an investment. Nice splurge for a spa night, and because the product comes out via a pump, it's going to be sanitary for all the participants.<br \/>It's going to make for some really fun and Instagram worthy photos!<br \/><br \/>xxoo<br \/><br \/>PS, my 'spa night' pal doesn't look too impressed 😆","title":"Like a Peach Bellini for your Face!","timestamp":1616359387784}

So when my oldest seen these and I used them in her hair she was like ok I want one now too and then I also thought these would be great for my son who also has tons of hair and curly hair at that. So now everyone has one and I think I may sadly be getting another set for my daughters when there at their dads house too. They love these brushes and I have to attest using these to comb thru their hair makes things a world easier and less of a hassle I do wish they had a grip on the handle for wet hands but really outside of that I dont have any complaints. These come in packs of 2 and even if you dont have kids using one in a purse and keeping one home is enough reasons to get these especially if you have thick hair these are amazing. My kids are mixed and range from hair length to neck length to butt length and I will tell you these are amazing at handling getting thru those thick tangles. The back has a piece that allows you to have the comb itself at different firmness I like the top one personally it is the firmest level.

After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall.

I knew that if I take a shower my pores would open up and it would be easier to vacuum out of my face without scarring but... I did the opposite :) I did that to see if it worked just as good, For those people who wouldn’t know what I knew at the time. When I tried it out, I was amazed to see that it still worked and there was no LONG LASTING effect. Now, do you have sensitive skin, so I had to go back and use one of the lower settings but I did try the higher ones and it left long red marks but they were gone once I woke up the next morning.

This set of six shades contains (1) Glitter, (3) Crèmes, (2) Magnetics, and a cats eye magnet wand needed to work the magnetic polishes. All of the colors cure for 60 secs in an LED lamp or 90 secs in a UV.<br \/><br \/>The crèmes are all buttery smooth in application, and self level beautifully. Each dry down to a nice glossy finish. The magnetics are easy to manipulate with the enclosed magnet stick. I was able to do a double cat eye line on my first try! (These are gonna be a lot of fun to play with using different shaped magnets for different effects.) Both magnetic polishes covered completely in one easy coat. The glitter shade is jam-packed with small royal blue glitters and is accented with a sprinkling of medium sized blue hexagons. The depth and sparkle to this polish is incredible. The glitter load makes this shade a little bit thick - but it's still workable. None of these gel polishes have a bad odor. None of them gave me any issues during application or the curing process. I cannot speak to the wear time, as I always use a peel-off base coat or full coverage tips, with gel polish products.<br \/><br \/>Because these are so rich in pigment, (and a lot of them are dark colors), it is best to work in thin coats. They do cure with a sticky layer. All of these (except the glitter) cured for 60 sec in my LED lamp. With the thickness and opacity of the glitter polish, I did a double cure on that one to be safe. All swatches in this review are ONE coat and are shown WITHOUT top coat.<br \/><br \/>I think the coverage, formula, and finishes of these polishes is amazing and absolutely worth the price.

I use eye creams and serums on a daily basis and twice a day because I find this area tends to reflect signs of aging sooner than the rest of my face. My goal is to always keep this area hydrated and moisturized at all times because of this!<br \/><br \/>Valentia's True Glow Eye Cream comes in a glass bottle with a pump action top. The product advertises as being an Intense Corrective Eye treatment, which not only works as a preventing regimen but also aids with current issues. The eye cream helps with:<br \/><br \/>Reducing Fine lines and Wrinkles<br \/>Restoring Radiance by helping repair and nourish the delicate skin around our eyes<br \/>Hydration from oils to Anti-inflammatory ingredients to reduce puffiness that may further diminish the appearance of aging skin.<br \/>Tightening the area around the eye by aiding with elasticity and targeting dark circles. which can make a person look tired and cause an irregular skin tone\/color effect to the area.<br \/><br \/>Retail Price Point: $25.00 via Amazon for a 1.18 ounce glass bottle with a pump action top.<br \/><br \/>Verdict:<br \/>I always give myself about 3 to 4 weeks when it comes to trying any beauty creams and serums. I need to know if the effects I experience belong to the product I am testing or they are just the remaining benefits from the one prior. I can then also get an idea how well a product performs! The first week of trying the eye cream from Valentia, I noticed the product tends to linger longer on the skin than my former eye cream. As much as I love quick absorbing products, my prior eye cream left no residue but also no hydrating protective layer. It would just vanish within four hours and if the day was even breezy in nature, I could feel that tight feeling your skin gets when it's drying out too much. The True Glow Eye Cream from Valentia left a protective layer that kept my skin looking smoother longer through out the day. I used the product twice a day and experienced zero irritations from use. The thin layer allowed for make-up application after and no odd little rolled up residue balls formed hours later, or worse, when your make-up separates making it look like you forgot to blend. None of that happened! I did not notice fine line repair by week three, but I can state that the product is phenomenal went it comes to working as a prevention aid. I looked more awake because the skin in that area was smooth and naturally plump, not swollen from my seasonal allergies! My eyes water at night and when I sleep, creating what I call &#34;teary eyes&#34;. I get red streaks from the irritation if I forget to apply eye cream or applied a poorly formulated one. I can state the Valentia's True Glow Eye cream prevented any red marks from setting in, so I woke up looking fresh and not like I have been weeping! This is an eye cream I would continue to use but also along with the Ultra Plumping Hydrating Mask from Valentia. These two products help each other out and I get a balanced appearance that is noticeable with this duo.<br \/><br \/>I received the above product(s) free of charge from Valentia.

Each pair comes individually packaged, making this collected group of beauty accessories excellent swag-bag additions or party favor gifts! The included serum feels incredibly hydrating and smells absolutely divine. I’ve used several different brands of similar eye masks, and these are noticeably thicker and more substantial than every other pair I’ve tried! Even at room temperature, they instantly provide a cooling sensation when applied to the face. They adhere well to skin, but due to their weight and size, they do have a slight tendency to slip downward with gravity. For that reason, I suggest lying flat or reclining while wearing them, so that they stay as close to the lower lash line as possible. Each package still contains some extra serum after the eye masks are removed, so I massage that residual liquid onto my neck for added moisture potential. The combination of hyaluronic acid, collagen, and 24k nanogold particles leaves my under eye area feeling incredibly hydrated and refreshed. Consistent use of this product helps combat fine lines, puffiness, and dark circles over time, so I’m thrilled the whole set is so affordable!

I’ve been using this coconut based hand soap daily and find it pleasant. It glides and lathers well when I rub my hands together and stays on my hands long enough to be thorough washing. This soap isn’t overly drying, though I almost always need lotion after hand washing. The lavender scent from essential oils is light, which is a plus as I’m not a fan of heavy scent. The container holds 12 oz. and the company sells 16 oz. refills (currently $6.95) in a paper based container styled like a milk carton to reduce plastic waste.<br \/><br \/>The glass container has a modern design that looks nice countertop. It has a beige or taupe color silicone (or similar) material on the bottom and lower sides that prevents slipping and adds breakage protection. The plastic pump is also beige and good quality but may not last as long as the glass container. Beige isn’t my favorite color but it’s neutral and the company offers a blue shade that looks pretty in the photo. This soap has coconut oil, olive oil, potassium soap, aloe juice, vitamin E, citrus acid, sodium chloride and a natural essential oil blend (not in that order). I assume “potassium soap” is potassium hydroxide (caustic lye), but believe it’s found in all liquid soap under various names.

This stuff leaves your face feeling clean and fresh after shaving.  Not only that but incredibly soft.<br \/><br \/>Moisture cream<br \/>This is really not something I use at all. I would think it best to use after shaving because you are stripping moisture from your face, but in that regard the shave cream is sufficient. I just don't personally have a need for a separate moisture cream. So it is sort of hard to form an opinion about it.<br \/>What I can tell you is that it doesn't really have a scent, my face does feel super soft. On the downside it is a little messy and I found myself wiping away the excess.<br \/><br \/>For the most part then I really like this set.

I definitely like this better than their collagen concentrate ampoules, but there are things that could have been changed to make me like this product a lot more.<br \/><br \/>-Received 7 glass ampoules with 2ml of product inside each one<br \/>-Well presented in a nice looking silver display box<br \/>-You have to snap the glass ampoules open. They do provide a plastic cylindrical piece to aid in doing so. I’m a nurse, so I’m used to breaking open these kinds of ampoules without any issue. I can imagine that some people would not like this though<br \/>-Watery serum that glides across skin easily<br \/>-Honestly, a little seems to cover a large area of skin. 2ml may not seem like a lot, but a single ampoule seems like way more than would be needed for one application. I have split one into 3-4 uses to be honest<br \/>-I’m assuming the company intends for one whole ampoule to be used as one application because each one is labeled as day 1-7, and they provide no way to seal an ampoule back after using which I found to be rather frustrating<br \/>-Absorbs rapidly and doesn’t feel sticky or tacky after drying like the collagen concentrate did<br \/>-Their collagen concentrate ampoules also had a heavy fragrance, so I was SO relieved to find that there is no added fragrance with these<br \/>-Made in Germany<br \/><br \/>So does it really help with plumping, smoothing, and reducing wrinkles? I don’t know. I definitely like the way my skin looks and feels right after application, but I haven’t noticed anything drastic.<br \/>As I previously stated, the 2ml of serum feels like A LOT to me if you try to put it all on your face at once. Unfortunately, this company also does not provide a way to seal an individual ampoule back for future use since they apparently intend for one ampoule to be an entire application. I remember I tried a set by the ISDIN brand with glass ampoules just like these. In the kit, the company included a top to slide over the opened glass ampoule with a cap to seal for future use. This was awesome and so convenient. I was disappointed to find out that this company did not include anything like that (I took a picture of that top and cap on one of these ampoules so you can see).<br \/><br \/>Anyway, it is possible that this product may provide good results when used long term, but I just don’t really like this being intended for use over 7 days only. If they included a top with cap to seal each individual ampoule so that the product could be used over a longer period of time, I would like it much more. I would definitely prefer a serum in a larger bottle with dropper lid.<br \/><br \/>Anyway, I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know – thanks!

It washes off quickly, resulting in what she calls a \"renewed\" sensation. Following the wash, she uses the moisturizer, and says it soaks into her skin naturally, leaving a very nice, non-oily feeling. However, my wife does not like the strong scent. She has experimented with the moisturizing oils that come with this. She says they definitely moisturize nicely, and she only needs a couple of dabs of the oils for nice effect. They do better than the scented cream in many ways, but she says they would not be great every day. The best combination would be the exfoliating element, followed by the moisturizing cream, but with no scent. If you don't mind strongly-scented creams, this might be different for you!<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is a terrific set.

It works for me, even if loofa does take a while to break in. However, it also absorbs quite a bit of soap. I like this one much better.<br \/><br \/>I was a little hesitant to order it. How would silicone feel against my back? It turns out that it feels fine and works well. I like that it needs much less soap since it doesn't absorb it. Instead of spreading it all over the thing - I like the side with little bristles like a brush - all you need is to put some in the center. Moving the brush over your back spreads the soap out nicely and does the job without a lot of waste. It squeaks a bit on un-soaped skin, but that's pretty easy to get over and doesn't last long. It was just a surprise, initially. It feels like a gentle scrub, and that's the important part. It also rinses off easily and dries quickly, an important point here in our humid climate. The interior relative humidity in our house hovers around 55% in the summer, so things can get moldy fast. That's what usually happens if a loofa or any other kind of absorbent surface isn't dried properly. I just hang this up on the thoughtfully provided suction hooks and forget about it.

Put this in the refrigerator and it's heaven to use!  Feels wonderful.  And at the same time it's helping to firm your face and neck.  The other box comes with dermarollers.  Two different sizes - one has a 1 1\/2\" head and the other is a 3\/4\" head.  I use the bigger one all over my face and then apply moisturizer.  It really helps it to absorb better.  The smaller one I use gently around my eyes.  But I mostly use it on my eyebrows with growth serum.  I roll the area first, apply the serum and roll again.  It helps to open up the hair follicles and allow the serum to absorb better. It's slightly painful and leaves your face red.  But it clears up in about an hour for me.

I started using Liquid Gold almost two weeks ago (just in time for a cold front and a huge snow storm) and I don't recognize my skin. I use Liquid Gold in the morning and right before bed every day. A little of it sits on the surface of my skin, but it never offsets on my pillow or clothing. After a half hour or so, it's completely absorbed. I'm 56, so I've been watching my skin go through all kinds of hormonal acrobatics, from rosacea to acne to uneven texture and coloring. Does Liquid Gold eliminate all of these flaws? No. But it DOES alleviate them and help improve my skin texture (no painfully dry papery skin! Blast the heater in the car-- I don't care!). The proof that this stuff works for me, though, is that I feel comfortable enough in my own skin to go out without makeup on most days. I'm not afraid of getting older and I'm not looking for a miracle cure, I just want my skin to look happy and healthy. It does.<br \/><br \/>The packaging is simple yet effective to prevent breakage during storage and transport. The bottle is in a muslin bag, which is nestled inside a thick cardboard cylindrical box with a snug lid, which is also nestled inside a cardboard box. A lot of care was taken with the package design to reflect the organic, down-to-earth approach that Auntie and Me takes with their products, and it is effective in preventing breakage.<br \/><br \/>If I'm being critical, I have to say that I really dislike the bottle itself. The glass bottle with a slick label and a dropper than dribbles and leaks is a disaster story in the making. The very first time I used the product, the dropper spilled a little on the outside of the bottle and it has been slick and hard to hold ever since. Some sort of texture on the bottle or label would be a very nice addition to prevent dropping an eighty-dollar bottle of oil.<br \/><br \/>I was brave and ordered the original scented version and I love it. I immediately picked up the camphory notes of the lavender with the resinous after notes of frankincense coming along afterwards. It's nothing overwhelming. Unfortunately, while I happen to love the smell of this version, one of my dogs won't come near me. She actually stopped sleeping in my room once I started using it. If I buy another bottle, I will go with the unscented version, unless I can get her to appreciate how good it smells.","title":"Whose skin is this?","timestamp":1642637470179}

I liked the idea of this brush, but the actual product really wasn't all that. First of all, this thing is much larger than any other slicker style brush I have. This is a great feature for my large dog, but it was just ridiculous trying to groom my cats with this large, unyielding wire brush. So, not a good choice for the cats.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, not a good choice for my dog either, as she has a short coat with little to no undercoat and she was really uncomfortable with wires dragging on her skin. She's more of a rubber curry comb type gal, I guess. Besides the size and wire bristle problems, the plastic itself felt a little brittle and cheap and when you add in the mechanics of retractable bristles... I think higher quality material would have been a better choice because that slider for the bristles is very basic. Finally, while I loved the idea of the easy-to-clean retractable bristles, they really aren't necessary and if those wires become crooked or bent it will cause all kinds of problems with the retraction. I've made it decades by just pulling the fur out of my slicker brushes-- it literally takes 2-3 seconds-- and while the thought of retractable bristles is nice, it totally isn't necessary. It's not a practical tool for me and doesn't work for any of my animals due to its size and the wire bristles. It also doesn't seem terribly well-made nor is it made of high-quality materials, and for the price it should be.","title":"I liked the idea better than the product","timestamp":1613596757942}

The oil does a very good job of conditioning and softening my beard and preventing fly-aways. You need to use it consistently and it takes a little time for it to really take effect but I truly does work great. Your beard will be softer without looking oily. It’s also scent free which I strongly prefer. Another review said it has a lemon scent. I’m not getting that and typically I’m pretty sensitive to odors. If there’s a scent it’s very subtle. I also use this oil for leg shaving. It makes the shaving process faster and safer (little to no cuts or nicks). Oil is preferable to cream so you can see what you’re doing and where you’re shaving. It’s thick enough to not require much product but not so thick that your razor is instantly gummed up. I’ve also used Pacific Shaving Company oil (too thin) and Shave Secret oil (too thick). Since this is an oil, I don’t often use it for moisturizing but it’s very effective in that capacity particularly if you have a very dry and stubborn area. I’m giving this product 5 stars because it works great for all it’s intended uses but the reality is that I’m unsure how often I will purchase it due to it’s high price.

I do it at night so I can relax while holding the unit at various places on my face. The red light goes on when you press slightly on the metal ring, as you can see in the photographs. As you press it to the area of your face that you want treated, slide it from the middle of your face outward, for 3 minutes. Then go to the next area. This way you get a little bit of a lymphatic massage. If you suffer with sinus headaches, this action is very good at offering some relief.<br \/> The cream is very lightly fragranced with a fresh scent. It's a gel or mousse type of cream.<br \/>After purchasing this, you can get the cream refill.<br \/><br \/>So much cheaper than buying an LED light device like a Tanda.","title":"Why this is a good value...","timestamp":1616003965064}

After using this set about 5 or 6 times now, I can say I am pretty happy with it and everything is just as I expected.

I definitely plan on getting some more of those. For the razor comb, I haven't really used that yet, but it looks to be ok quality. When I do get a chance to use it, I will update my review if anything ends up being wrong with it.

My first reaction was that I didn’t want to use it. Not only did it feel a little thick and sticky, there were those micro-beads in there that felt strange for a serum. I honestly thought, at first, that maybe I’d received a facial wash with scrubbing beads, but when I added water to it, it didn’t lather or foam.<br \/><br \/>I looked up the product online and found the French company who makes this serum and other beauty products. I was a little reassured so I decided to give it another try.<br \/><br \/>I applied a little of the serum on the back of my right hand. What amazed me is that once it sinked into my skin, the skin of my right hand took on a glow. I’m a skeptic when it comes to beauty products—the claims companies make don’t often pan out or are exaggerated—but I could see it, and still do, that glow\/illumination on my right hand versus my left hand, and over 30 minutes later it is still there. I love that glowing aspect of it.<br \/><br \/>As for softness, I really don’t see any difference from this product and others but that doesn’t bother me. What I am interested in is how it is illuminating my skin as advertised. As for what other claims the company says the serum does, that’s a little more difficult to determine except with continued use over time, but if I like how a serum feels and if it gives my skin that glow, then I’m happy enough to try it and see what happens.<br \/><br \/>There is no irritation to my skin, no burning, itching, redness.<br \/><br \/>The beads do soften onto the skin as you apply it. Here’s what the company says about how to apply (which is kind of a weird different way to apply it-I still want to do the circular thing!): ‘Apply with the flat of the hand, without making circular motions, but starting from the middle of the face towards the outside of the face, to explode the jojoba micro-beads and to release the vitamins E and C on your skin.’<br \/><br \/>It is a little difficult to apply a serum onto your face with the flat of your hand, but I did try patting it with my fingers and that worked better.<br \/><br \/>It will feel sticky when you first apply it, and you can feel those beads. However, the stickiness goes away and the beads do melt onto your skin.<br \/><br \/>The price isn’t shown on Amazon. I looked up the price on the company’s website and it’s $49.90 Francs (I am assuming it’s Francs), and that’s only about $8 in American dollars. So I don’t know what the final price will be here on Amazon or how they’ll do that. I’d pay a decent price for this serum just for that glow.<br \/><br \/>It is advertised to be partially organic and mostly natural. The company’s advert reads: ‘99.85% natural ingredients of which 28.79% organic. Phytema ™ Skincare Radiance Serum is an ultra-concentrated anti-aging, anti-radical & anti-stain active ingredient. All the effectiveness of white mulberry, cucumber and bearberry, to prevent and fade pigment spots. Natural smoothing agents provide an immediate tightening effect to your face. No phenoxyethanol, no silicone, no paraben.’<br \/><br \/>I’m willing to give this serum a try, and this company I’ve not heard of, Phytema, a try.","title":"A different approach to my skincare","timestamp":1542892259772}

Like many reviewers, I was put off by the sheer amount of packaging that came along with this item. It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't tout how conscious they were of environmental issues, but I've purchased Chanel with less packing, come on!<br \/><br \/>All of the beauty and skin care products I consume are luxury, at the moment I've been using Dr. Gross's skin care line but until I could get back to Sephora, I've been using Purity cleanser.  I was hoping this product would be a suitable replacement but I'm not convinced so let me tell you about the photos.<br \/><br \/>Each night I cleanse my face with Purity using Clarasonic's Uplift with the Revitalizing brush.  I follow this with micellar water (by Borghese) and then a serum and moisturizer.  The whole thing takes about 7 minutes (it's therapy, don't judge!).<br \/><br \/>Upon waking, I swabbed my face with the micellar water and then took a picture of the cotton ball along with an untouched cotton ball for comparison.  And by the way for the uninitiated, micellar water is the best skincare product to come out since mascara was invented.  I was sure that my $349 Clarasonic erased all traces of dirt no matter the soap, but the micellar water never lies.<br \/><br \/>On the second morning, first thing, I used the Clarasonic with the Radiance brush and three pumps of LaClaire Foaming Botanical Facial Cleanser.  Two pumps did not create a bit of lather.  Then using micellar water, I swabbed my face again and there you have the picture of both -- no cleanser and cleanser.<br \/><br \/>You can see that there is still a lot of dirt left behind after using this cleanser, certainly less than no cleanser at all but there is still some there.  There is less dirt left after washing with Purity so I wouldn't call it a miracle cleanser, it's really just \"okay.\"","title":"Using this cleanser with Clarasonic","timestamp":1535721737194}

It has a matte look to it.<br \/><br \/>The contour stick was what really interested me in this set. So many cream contour sticks labeled as “contour” end up being really warm toned. Contour is supposed to mimic your natural shadows, so it’s supposed to be cool toned, even grey toned. But, it’s hard to find one that’s actually cool toned, and even harder finding one that’s grey toned. This one looked like it was neutral, leaning cool with a kind of rosy undertone. So, I wanted to give it a try. The few rosy\/pink toned contour\/bronzer sticks I’ve found have worked well for me as bronzers because I have neutral leaning slightly cool skin.<br \/><br \/>On me, thus leans more warm toned than I’d like. But, once blended out, it isn’t as orange as others. Of course, it could be different for you, depending on your undertone. While it doesn’t work as a contour for me like it wanted, it does make a nice bronzer for me. The formula of it is nice. It’s soft, smooth, creamy. It blends easily. I never swipe sticks like these onto my face. I always take my sponge or brush, dab it onto the stick, and then blend it onto my skin. I find that works better and I don’t need to worry about whether swiping it directly on will lift my foundation underneath. This is pigmented, but it blends out so easily that it’s easy to blend it away. I find if I pick up and apply a little, it blends out easily and looks natural on my skin but I just need to be careful not to blend it away! But, I can also build it up for a more intense color. I like that. Once blended out, it is matte and dries down to a powder like finish that I don’t need to set and it lasts all day without any issues.<br \/><br \/>The highlighter is okay. It’s too glittery for my liking. I like more of a pearl look without glitter. But if you don’t mind micro glitter, you might like this. Its really subtle aside from the glitter so I just think there’s better options.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I think it’s worth it for the contour\/bronzer side. It works really well and is easy to work with (when dabbing your brush\/sponge onto the stick and then applying it) and it sets down on its own with a matte powder like finish without needing to be set. I wouldn’t recommend the highlighter. It’s just really sheer other than glitter so I think there’s better options. But, if you like a sheer but glittery highlighter, then this could work for you. I give it 4 stars because I really like the bronzer, I just don’t like the highlighter.","title":"Nice bronzer but don’t like the highlighter","timestamp":1670168906144}

You apply the cream to skin that is clean and dry. You simply pump out the amount needed and apply to your thighs, stomach, legs, and anywhere you wish to address! Use a healthy amount of motion to make sure the cream penetrates and the caffeine hits those targeted areas. I went with a deep massage and allowed the cream to fully dry before dressing.<br \/><br \/>What to Expect- Cellulite is one of those attributes you hear everyone has but that does not make you love it, or much less accept it. While over-the-counter products will not fully remove the appearance of the skin, it certainly can diminish it. I’m all for zapping it any way I can and InstaNatural’s Cellulite cream does aid with this pesky little problem. Thank the healthy amount of Caffeine in the product because it not only minimizes the appearance but provides you with instant results. You get to see a difference on the first day but it does not stop there. The cream has a nice amount of moisturizers like Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter, which penetrate and soften the appearance of the cellulite and surrounding skin. Then comes the Retinol punch that helps in not only repairing but rejuvenation, and by this I mean, it helps the “turn-over” process of shedding our “damaged” looking skin quicker.  The Retinol helps produce a less marked skin in less time than if not used! The cellulite\/dimple mark will still be present but with continual use, you can achieve a minimizing look and the finer lines will be less visible, along with the dimples. I found the cream to not only help moisturize and produce softer and a more supple skin’s surface, but it also produced a more firmer appearance that was visible to the eye and touch. I am all for the instant results and especially as the days get warmer and the bikini is due to come out!<br \/><br \/>I received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.

(Before COVID-19), I wouldn’t have known the difference between a barber’s cape and a bullfighter’s cape. But today, home hair cutting is now the norm, and a barber’s cape is practically a necessity.<br \/><br \/>This SmoTecQ one does the job with little drama. Measuring an adult-sized 57 by 63 inches, it has an elasticized neckband with two thin but sturdy metal clasps that can adjust to fit tightly around any size neck. The fabric in the back tended to gape open a little when I tested it, and it’s much shorter in the back than in the front, but overall it does a good job at what it’s intended to do. Hair doesn’t stick to it too badly, so it’s relatively easy to wipe clean after use. Folding it up to try to put it neatly back into its plastic storage bag was a challenge.<br \/><br \/>That’s not to say that hair still doesn’t go all over the floor, though, and that’s why my amateur haircuts, whether I’m getting them or giving them, take place on one of my outdoor patios.<br \/><br \/>Based on my zero knowledge of what makes a good one or a bad one, I have to rate this barber’s cape at a middle-of-the-road three stars. I wish I didn’t need one at all, but in the current reality, it’s a must-have item, and this one seems to do the job.","title":"A Necessity for Home Hair Cutting","timestamp":1594574452818}

Only 9 ingredients. It is so good. Truly comforting and non-irritating. Even when my skin is already in an irritated state.<br \/><br \/>This is a beautifully thick, rich, white moisturizing cream. Yet, somehow it feels decently lightweight and comfortable on the face and neck. Not lightweight like a gel cream, by any means. But comfortable. This cream glides onto the face and neck smoothly, and it soaks into the skin quickly; But it doesn't disappear. It leaves a lasting, soothing, comforting layer of moisture and hydration on the surface of the skin. It helps to lock-in the moisture and hydration from the previous steps in my skincare routine, and leave my skin feeling so lovely and comfortable.<br \/><br \/>The scent is extremely slight. It is herbal, but it's almost undetectable, unless you're really seeking after the scent.<br \/><br \/>The packaging is a beautiful yellow glass jar with a beige twist-off lid. It feels very nice in the hand, and the cream feels luxurious on the face. Much more expensive than it is. The 80ml size is excellent for the price.<br \/><br \/>The addition of gentle, anti-aging Bakuchiol is also a big win with zero irritation. Plus, Shea Butter for maximum moisture. I layer gentle, hydrating, soothing, calming toners and serums underneath this cream, and I get excellent glowy, dewy results.<br \/><br \/>I use this cream day and night, as I have dry, sensitive skin. I imagine many skin types might like this for day or night, especially during colder months.<br \/><br \/>If you have sensitive skin, and you cannot use most skincare products (like me), this is likely going to be for you.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I'm highly impressed.

It turns out, that using this is not painful at all.  But when used on my forehead, it looks like it has more pores.

You may be able to use this every other day.<br \/><br \/>The device is light weight, and rechargeable, but comes with batteries, so you don’t have to charge before use; this makes it easy to bring on travel.

Some kits try to force a look, but this one was open to play with. Maybe not the best idea for a beginner kit- but I enjoyed that.<br \/><br \/>First the good:<br \/>I like this type of lamp when I'm doing gel- it's easy together both my hands in to hold the nail down when I first start, then I usually pick up the light and rotate it to get a full cure. Yes I have to restart the lamp a few times, but this isn't an expensive lamp so I don't mind.<br \/><br \/>I liked the little box they came in- sure it's cheep, but it was a nice tough to have (almost) everything in once place.<br \/><br \/>Then the annoying:<br \/><br \/>There are a lot of odd little problems, like the Gel itself, two are jelly clear and one is opaque. Opaque gel takes a little longer to cure because the light works a bit harder to travel though the nail. It would have been helpful if they mentioned that, OR only gave you one type of gel-so it doesn't confuse you-- but they didn't.<br \/><br \/>The nail forms were a bad fir for my hand. Thats just an unlucky break- all hands are diffrent- so im not including that in my rating, just something to mention in case they don't work for you too.<br \/><br \/>The colors were a little annoying to use, no color indicator on the bottle. this is common with cheeper sets, but I thought I'd mention it anyway- It can make doing your nails just a little bothersome.<br \/><br \/>The ugly-<br \/>they don't include slip solution-I ended up using my own from my nail kit, so I didn't have any problems, but that's a huge mistake on their part-- if you're just starting out you'll think gel nails are a sticky mess. Slip solution makes them manageable.<br \/><br \/>Overall- I feel like there are better kits that will give you a cleaner start over this one--<br \/><br \/>I hope this review was helpful!","title":"I wouldn't start with this--","timestamp":1597208143749}

Well here we are in a pandemic wearing face masks. Someone came up with the idea of a head band with buttons to hold the mask mask in place.<br \/><br \/>This is a thin material. Think very thin t shirt type material. The headband measures about 18 inches and just over 3 inches wide. I like the material for a headband. However, its use as a mask holder is iffy. Many people complain that the elastic that holds the masks in place makes their ears pop out. That is definitely true of some masks. They can also be wearying on the ears, having that elastic against your ears all day, so this headband is a great concept.<br \/>I put the headband on and as I stretched it over my head, I heard a pop, so some stitching gave somewhere.<br \/><br \/>I attached two types of masks, one at a time. First, it was a bit fiddly to get the elastic over the button. Once it just sprang off.<br \/><br \/>One mask using the buttons fit well. Another did not. The latter mask opened up on the sides.<br \/><br \/>I would hesitate to wear this out thinking that everything would stay put for hours. I like the headband as a headband. It's nice material.

It feels light, absorbs quickly and moisturizes my skin fairly well. This lotion leaves my hands and skin soft, silky and comfortable. I don’t feel my dry skin gets as much hydration as I get with my favorite premium body butters and creams, but those are heavier products so I don’t expect as much from a lotion.<br \/><br \/>When applied after my shower, I get about 8 hours of hydration. That’s pretty good, though not the 24 hours claimed on the site. I do have dry skin and find this lotion hydrates better than most lotions. I’ve occasionally found one that gives me longer lasting hydration, but it’s uncommon. Excipial keeps my dry skin comfortable and itch free more like 12 hours but has chemicals such as parabens, while Guayaquil Hemp Lotion emphasizes organic and natural ingredients (but does have Phenoxyethanol).<br \/><br \/>Guayaquil Hemp Lotion feels gentle and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin at all. It doesn’t list chemical fragrance and is labeled fragrance free, which is a big plus as some fragrances trigger sensitivities for me. But it still may have fragrance. I smell a faint non offensive scent and don’t know if it’s from added “essential oil” (last ingredient) or just the natural scent of the natural ingredients.<br \/><br \/>Guayaquil Hemp Lotion has 250 mg of CBD (THC free), which is still being studied but “may” hydrate dry skin and help inflammation. The ingredients look good but this lotion does have moderately risky (per EWG) Phenoxyethanol in the top ten ingredients and drying alcohol in the bottom 5.

This Luminous Face oil comes in a dark glass dropper bottle like a lot of facial oils do. It is not cheap at almost $100 to be honest. When you use this you will need about a drop for each side of your face, so a little does go a long way, but this is still not an inexpensive product so handle this as such.<br \/><br \/>This particular one is filled with pomegranate oil, cacao oil infused with white peony root, marigold flower and lotus leaf. This particular blend is supposed to be brightening, soothing, regenerating, purifying and reduce the appearance of dullness. When you use this you will notice this oil definitely has a fragrance to it that is reminiscent of an essential oil. They recommend to use it morning and night, however in my experience when you use this it does absorb fairly quickly. It does leave an oily residue on your skin though. If you wear makeup and especially right now with wearing masks, I would not recommend applying this facial oil in the morning. For a makeup application that could cause trouble and I found with facial oils I sweat heavily when wearing masks.<br \/><br \/>It provided some moisture but I didn’t really see a brightening effect to be honest, however I did feel that my skin felt oily which is why I prefer using this in the evening. In the morning my skin felt nicely moisturized. Is this really worth the price? In my eyes not really since I have other brighteners that do the same thing and cost a fraction of this oil while not making my face greasy.","title":"Underwhelmed - didn't work for me","timestamp":1602948560135}

It didn't take me long to realize that I really, really loved this face wash.<br \/><br \/>It arrives in a relatively small 4-ounce bottle. The face wash includes 20% Vitamin C along with Organic Aloe Vera, MSM, and Organic Rose Hip Oil. It utilizes the actual lemon peel, a process that is noted to contain 5-10 times more vitamins than the lemon juice. The wash is designed to naturally exfoliate, remove blackheads, and naturally lighten the skin.<br \/><br \/>While the 4-ounce bottle seems quite small, it takes very little to do the job. The wash comes out as a sort of milky lotion that lathers lightly yet effectively. The lemon peel contains citric and phytic acids and I felt that sort of acidic quality on my face, but it was lighter than a typical exfoliant. It left my skin cleaner, but in a healthy way rather than in a glowing way.<br \/><br \/>This is designed to be a daily face wash. I'm not completely sure I'd use it on a daily basis given its price point, but I have to admit it feels so natural and has been so effective that I may be convinced otherwise by the time this first bottle is actually done. I love the way that it's making my face look and feel and I'm super pleased with the healthier appearance.<br \/><br \/>For me, this has turned out to be rather gentle giant of a face wash.

Protected on a lot of bubble wrap. With how often eyeshadow palettes come with broken shadows, I always appreciate when one comes with extra care taken to protect it! The palette has cardboard packaging. There’s an outer sleeve cover. It has the exact same look on the front and back on the outer sleeve cover as it does on the outer packaging of the palette. The shade names are found on the back of the palette and are also labeled under each shade inside the palette, which I like. A lot of affordable palettes, they don’t have the shade names inside, which is usually fine with me because it’s so affordable and they have to cut costs somewhere. So, when the shade names are included inside the palette on affordable palettes, I always appreciate it. There’s also a big mirror that is just a little smaller than the lid. Again, a lot of affordable palettes don’t have mirrors, which is another way to cut costs for the companies to make the palette a cheaper price. Again, not something I mind since it’s affordable. So, again, when I see mirrors in affordable palettes, I appreciate it. There’s also a removable plastic sheet cover over the shades inside the palette.<br \/><br \/>The shades are all beautiful. (See photos of swatches).<br \/><br \/>The mattes have good pigment, feel smooth, not chalky at all. Brushes pick them up well and they apply on the eyes nicely. A few shades need built up a little more, but not too much where I get annoyed 😂<br \/><br \/>The shimmers\/metallics are smooth, pigmented, and pretty shimmery. A brush picks them up easily, and they apply easily and look beautiful using fingers or brushes.<br \/><br \/>There’s 2 pressed glitters. 1 of them isn’t small circular kind of glitters. It’s small stars. I don’t really love when pressed glitters are in a palette. I have a love hate relationship with glitter. Love the look of it, hate how it gets EVERYWHERE, you’re finding glitter particles everywhere for a while after you use it. Plus, they aren’t safe for the eyes. Get some in the eye and you can scratch your cornea! But, smaller glitter particles aren’t too bad in my opinion. However, with the one in this palette that has stars, those would be waaaaaay more risky than smaller circular like glitter particles. The stars are bigger and have extremely pointy edges. Plus, it’s hard to pick up with your finger. So, I really don’t like that pressed glitter. The other pressed glitter is made up of tiny particles. It picks up easily, sticks pretty good on its own, great with a wet base like concealer or glitter glue. So, I don’t like that 2 shades are pressed glitters, but the palette is so affordable, 2 I don’t like and probably won’t use out of the 18 isn’t so bad to me.<br \/><br \/>There’s 1 shade that is a concealer shade. It’s a cream kind of concealer. I fear it would dry out, so I’ll be putting a piece of tape over it, with the edge bent over together to leave a little tab to pull it up if I want to use it (I did this with my Huda New Nude palette and the concealer shade hasn’t dried up). The shade is pretty thin and waxy feeling. I don’t feel I’ll ever really use it, but just in case figure I’d keep it from drying out.<br \/><br \/>This is a dupe for Hudas New Nude palette (see swatch photos comparing the 2).<br \/>- They even have the shades named the exact same as the shades in Hudas palette, except one that is named “Spanked” in Huda is named “Spaked” in this palette and one that is named “Love Bite” in Huda is names “EITE” in this palette 🤦‍♀️ 😂 (see photos to see both palettes together).<br \/>- All of the shades and their placement in this palette correspond exactly to the shades and their placement in Hudas palette, except the shades “Spanked” and “Love Bite,” and “Concealed” and “Play.” In both palettes, “Spanked” and “Love Bite” are in the first row, the last 2. But, in this palette it’s, “Spaked” and “Love Bite” and in the Huda palette it’s “Love Bite” and “Spanked.” In the Huda palette, “Concealed” is the concealer shade and “Play” is a light peach matte shade. In this palette “Concealed” is a nude type shade, that has a little peachy color to it and “Play” is the concealer shade. So, in the Huda palette there’s a light peach matte shade called “Play” that this palette does not have (this palette has a nude with a slight peach tint to it).<br \/>- Other than that, the shades are pretty spot on. In the Huda palette, the metallics feel just a little creamier, but not by much. In this palette they feel really smooth, not chunky at all. As you can see in the swatches, the metallic shades aren’t quite as metallic as they are in the Huda palette, but they are pretty darn close. The colors of all the shades are also pretty darn close. I’d say the shade that’s most off, other than the light peach matte shade not being a full on peach shade and more of a nude shade with a peach tint in this palette, the other shade that’s the most off is “Kinky.” In the Huda palette it’s a deeper, richer red. In this palette it’s more of a burnt orange type red or rust kind of red. You can see in the swatches. Then, the “Concealed” shade in the Huda palette, the corresponding shade in this palette is “Play.” The Huda one is creamier, and has more color. As I said before, the one in this palette is thinner and waxy feeling. The pressed glitters - “Excite” is made of small, red glitter particles in both palettes. The Huda one is smoother feeling, not so rough feeling. “Infatuated” in this palette is totally different than Hudas, it’s silver and stars, not red with small glitter particles.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I think this is a great palette. Good packaging, a nice mirror inside. The shades perform well. The mattes are smooth and blend easily and have good pigment. The metallic shades are smooth and pigmented and look beautiful. If you were looking for a nude\/pink palette, this is a great choice! If you have been wanting the Huda palette but didn’t like the cost of it, this is a great choice instead. The colors are pretty spot on, the differences are slight where once they’re on the eye, it wouldn’t be too noticeable. Other than the star pressed glitter and the nude shade with some peach in it. This palette would definitely give you the same looks. I really do think it’d a great affordable palette!","title":"Great Palette! Great Dupe!","timestamp":1604424115612}

After taking off the backing, it takes a little maneuvering to get these to sit in place. Firstly, the thin material wanted to bunch and roll along the edges of the face, and the lack of thickness made it difficult to get to lay flat. Also, the eye holes aren't quite right. I, my son, and my daughter tried them (each with very different face sizes) and all of us had trouble with the eyes. When they were in position, The bridge of the nose wouldn't stay pressed against the skin, but kept lifting up. The suggested wear time is 20 to 25 minutes, which is longer than the 15 to 20 I normally see on masks. Removing the mask, however, is no problem, and there's a good amount of moisture left over to massage into the skin....which also works well<br \/><br \/>The masks are moistening and have a gentle, pleasant odor (although I can't really place it). These are refreshing and leave the skin shiny. If only they'd sit better, I'd enjoy them more.","title":"Moistens","timestamp":1604066935059}

Well I am surprised at how effective this spray is.  Instead of touching the cortisone rub at all - I just sprayed this on the backs of my hands.  Granted I was working form home for the entire day - so I pretty much sprayed it a bunch of times over the course of the day.  The redness got MUCH better.  And the flakiness totally went away.  The only thing is my skin on the bad hand looked a bit dry - but I guess that is because this is a spray and not an emollient cream or anything.

I’m not a fan of the “natural look” makeup, i like a bold eye, and you can have that with this palette. I particularly love the Red, Dark Blue, Gray and Black shades. And if you find that you want the red to look darker, you can add a bit of black into the crease, and deepen it. I always want palettes to have a black pan - it’s useful for other things like lining, and smoking out.<br \/><br \/> If you choose to use an eyeshadow primer (or even just a concealer or foundation) then the colour payoff is more intense. If you don’t wear a primer, you might need to add more on top.

A little goes a long way, just a few drops per leg (or you can add a drop to your regular shave gel). Helps reduce irritation and you can see where you are shaving! I can't live without it. It's better than any foam, gel or lotion on the market. Truly the best shave experience. I have thick hair and dry flaky skin that is prone to itching and sensitivity. I use this bath oil with a cheapie disposable razor and a few drops of body oil after a shower and my legs are silky for days. Literally days. No razor burn, no irritation, no frustration. I prefer unscented products and this is truly unscented--thank you! Please use caution when using oils in the tub, but I haven't had any problems with the tub getting slippery. Only thing I would change in a better bottle with a pump or dropper top. It's easy to use too much. A little goes a long way so if you're hesitant about the price, don't be, because you'll end up spending more in the long run on something cheaper.<br \/><br \/>Also, used this as a body wash after getting a little too much sun today, and my skin was super soothed.  I think it will help prevent my skin from developing a sunburn--bonus!

While I don't use face masks every day, it has taken me a while to use just a few of them, and specific masks, like the hydration mask, aren't best suited for my face type. Out of the whole set, my favorite masks have been the brightening and antioxidant masks. While I was slightly hesitant to use the antioxidant mask at first due to my oily combo skin, it left me with no clogged pores or irritation, and it brightened and soothed my skin.<br \/><br \/>As I mentioned initially, I don't use face masks too often, and the masks I usually use are pretty cheap. Trying these masks has ruined me a little because it will be hard to go back to my regular masks. The one thing I don't like about these masks is the price. I think $42 is a little bit much for seven face masks, but it depends on how often you use face masks and how much of a splurge you want them to be. in terms of quality, I think the Karuna masks are great.","title":"High Quality Masks that Don't Irritate the Skin","timestamp":1614452034470}

The carabiner is small, but it's strong enough to keep the bottle where it needs to be as long as there isn't serious weight constantly pulling on it. So far, so good.<br \/><br \/>The thing I worry about most with a little bottle like this is what happens if you put a lot of pressure on it (sit on it, lean against the wall when it's in a pocket or on a belt loop, etc). I was concerned that the flip top would pop open and I'd end up with hand sanitizer all over the place, but I tested these little guys full of liquid before filling with sanitizer. The pliability of the silicone doesn't allow a burst of pressure to push off the flip top-- not even close. Plus, the top screws tightly into place.

My skin doesn't get irritated or dry, and the lubrication seems to help the shave to go more quickly.  I've tried other brands of shavers and this one seems to work the best.<br \/><br \/>This package comes with a squeeze bottle full of a very pleasant smelling lotion, that you inject into the back of the shaver.  Then, when you are shaving, you just press a button and it releases enough lotion to lubricate about one third of the face.  When it starts to feel like a dry shave, you press the button again and finish up.<br \/><br \/>I have found that the amount of lotion you can inject into the shaver is enough for about 5 to 6 shaves.  The shaver comes with a small sample bottle of the lotion -- and I guess one drawback is that you have to keep buying the lotion, unless you want to use this like an ordinary dry shaver.  I've tried that too and it seems to work as well as any other shaver I've tried.  I prefer, though, to use the lotion.  It feels good and has a nice aftershave smell that my wife also likes -- that's good enough for me.<br \/><br \/>Because the system is water resistant, you can shave in the shower, and you can wash it off in water when you are finished.  The extendable trimmer isn't very useful, but I've never seen a shaver where they are.  It comes fully recharged and after about two weeks of using it about every other day it is still working well -- I haven't charged it yet.  I do wish there was some kind of indicator on the unit that would let me know how much charge remains, but all in all I am quite happy with this.","title":"Works great for me -- I like the smell of the lotion, and the smoothness it brings to the shave","timestamp":1215636794000}

This cleanser has fragrance that smells relatively light to me, though fragrance is an ingredient that poses health risks. I generally avoid foaming face cleansers as they tend to make my skin overly dry, but this has a pleasing creaminess and initially made my skin feel good. It cleaned my skin well yet left it feeling refreshed, soft and comfortable after use.<br \/><br \/>After using this wash more than a few days in a row, it felt more clarifying (better for oily skin) than hydrating to my skin. While it didn’t strip my skin or make it visibly irritated, by the end of the week my skin just didn’t feel as comfortable as it did at first and it felt like my skin would end up too dry if I continued daily use. So I switched back to my creamy, hydrating cleansers, but felt this cleanser would still be good to use as needed as a clarifying cleanser.<br \/><br \/>However, while this wash has some good ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Aloe Extract and Sodium Hyaluronate, this has controversial Triethanolamine (“TEA”) high on the ingredient list. It’s on my personal list of ingredients to avoid after reading many articles about it and seeing it on lists of risky chemical by many sources. Some sources say it’s safe in amounts we get thru cosmetics, but I’m concerned about the cumulative effect of risky chemicals.<br \/><br \/>TEA is a nitrosamine used to generate foam and adjust pH and is likely a hormone disrupter and irritant. But the bigger issue for me is that TEA gets absorbed through the skin and reacts with other chemicals to form the carcinogen NDEA. While less risky in rinse off products, it still poses more risk than I’m comfortable with. The problem is that I have no way to know if this cleanser or any product I’m using with it has chemicals that react with TEA.<br \/><br \/>So, for me, I find it best to avoid all products with TEA, especially since so many alternative products are available that don’t have it. I also dislike that this has so much Cocamidopropyl Betaine (second ingredient), which I generally avoid mostly due contamination concerns. Fragrance also poses health risks, though it’s a common ingredient I don’t avoid altogether (but I do try and minimize use). All things considered, this is just okay for me. 3 stars.","title":"Pleasant But Feels More Clarifying Than Hydrating To My Dry Skin-Has Risky Ingredient TEA","timestamp":1669914635772}

This review is for: Nail Polish Gel Remover Tools Kit for Women with Nail Clip Caps, Nail File, Nail Remover Cotton Pads,Brush, 2-in-one Cuticle Scraper\/Pusher.<br \/><br \/>First things first, I was surprised to come here to write this review and discover that I received no dispenser bottle as listed and pictured in the product description. Since this kit does NOT come with the remover liquid,  you are going to have to buy some acetone. (In my state, you must be 21 to buy it.) Since this came with no bottle, I followed the directions on the acetone itself, and used a glass measuring cup in which to pour it. (This way if I didn't use it all, I could easily pour it back into the bottle. Note to self, buy another measuring cup!)<br \/><br \/>With that out of the way, this kit worked as described. I used tweezers and soaked the little pads in acetone and then wrapped it around my nail and applied the clamp. I did this to all of my nails at once, because my husband was here to help me with the second hand. If you have no one to help you, then you're going to need to do each hand separately. It is impossible to do much with these clamps on your fingernails. Once the clamps are on, you need to wait at least 20 minutes before removing them, to soften up the polish.<br \/><br \/>Once I removed the clamps I set to work scraping off the polish. It does NOT come right up like regular polish does, but if you've soaked them for 20 minutes, and you applied it in thin layers when you originally polished them, it's easy to scrape the rest of it off. Once you're done, your nails look pretty bad. It will be necessary to buff them out and then wash them and apply some moisturizing lotion because your nails and the tips of your fingers will be very, very dry.<br \/><br \/>I have heard some real horror stories of people trying to get gel nails and gel nail polish off, but this kit made it much easier and alleviated my fears.

It’s very thin in the top and the cap bunches up in spots so that you can clearly see the wefts in the crown. There are no clips and the cap is a bit large but quite comfortable. The hairline is badly done. The fabric of the cap extends past the hair and is clearly visible. If you are looking for something super cheap to wear there are better options. If you want a wig that you can learn styling on or use to test heated products on then this is the one.","title":"So Bad","timestamp":1582412971593}

My first impressions were very positive - the ingredients looked clean and natural, as well as being cruelty-free and vegan, I love that it’s plastic free (both the lack of bottle and the packaging), and that the scent options were relatively gender neutral.  The bars were a little smaller than I expected, but ergonomically they fit comfortably in the palm of my hand and don't seem to be shrinking too fast after a week or so of use.  I'm glad that they have different colors, so that I can differentiate between my bar soap, shampoo, and conditioner!<br \/><br \/>My experience using them was pretty good.  It felt odd at first as I've only ever used bottled products, but quickly got used to it and could definitely see myself using more bars in the future.  I tried both running the conditioner bar down my hair and lathering it up a little in my hand and applying that way.  Between the two, I felt that I got pretty good coverage and results.  My hair felt less tangled and I was able to work a brush through pretty easily once I got out the shower.  When my hair dried, it seemed softer and healthier looking than it had previously, and my curls had a little more life to them.<br \/><br \/>I only have two concerns - the first is that I'm struggling to find a place to put the bars in my shower where they won't get misted by water and disintegrate more quickly that way.  The second is the smell.  Although it's not unpleasant, it reminded me a little of a scented candle, and was very strong.  Three different people commented on the smell of my hair that week, which is not something that usually happens to me.  My husband thought that I smelled like cologne!  I could see this being a pro or a con depending on how you feel about fragrances.  Personally, I found it overwhelming as I'm more on the sensitive side to smells.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I would consider trying this or a similar product again in the future, but only with a less intense scent.","title":"Strong fragrance","timestamp":1641831469932}

Some gold is really fine and distributes as an even shimmer across your lips.

It has more of a youthful, party feel. I agree it's a color reminiscent of sunsets, suited for summer and fall. The case is possibly the most sophisticated I own though. It has a nice weight, and the magnetic closure feels good. It came in a box and in a sealed bag. I don't mind wearing this color, but I wouldn't buy it again.

And I know I’m an amazon vine member so a lot of people will scoff at my review but I’m being totally honest here. Does it work for cellulite? I’m not sure. I feel like it does and it sort of looks like it. But I’ve only been applying once a day instead of twice like it says. It feels very firming though and so moisturizing, I also don’t spend too much time massaging like I should.<br \/><br \/>To be honest, at first trying, I didn’t want to really use it. I didn’t like the smell. But after finally trying it, I LOVE it! The smell dissipates after a few minutes. You don’t smell all menthol like. It actually smells pleasant after a few minutes. Trust me, I would hate anything menthol on skin smelling. If you have trouble with the pump, it’s not the pump, it’s just really rich and thick and is a little harder to pump out. It moisturizes better than even a name brand popular lotion. And stays with you like that for 24 hours. Yet it doesn’t feel too thick or cakey.<br \/><br \/>My favorite part and what I think it should be advertised for is arthritis or other autoimmune stuff that causes aches and pains. Anyone with fibromyalgia would want to own stock in this stuff. Hot flashes, this is your freedom. It leaves you cool and refreshed. I feel even cleaner. It’s great in summer.

I imagine most people have some sort of access to a USB plug but if you do not, you are going to need to buy one.

The curling clasp holds my long hair securely as does the straightening iron. Two features that are great are the long swivel cord and the fact that this is dual voltage - that is a feature that is getting harder to find on hair appliances. I travel a lot and like that I only need to bring one hair tool with me, whether in the US or abroad. Even at home it is great to not have to heat up two different tools if I need to curl parts of my hair and straighten others.

The box has “To be a sexy lady surprise yourself” on the front along with a red heart sticker that seals the lid and says “Surpise!” Then, under that it says “She Loves” and below that says “True Love Classic Velvet Lip Gloss.” It’s really cute outer packaging. Once you remove the outer plastic wrapping, the back of the box just has a bunch of Chinese writing (see photos), so I like they at least put that sticker on the back on the outside of the plastic wrapping.<br \/><br \/>The tubes are really small, but cute. They are a kind of matte white with “SHE LOVES” written in silver holographic letters going all around the top. The caps are matte and the color of shade of lipstick, and the bottom of each tube has a sticker that’s the color of the shade of lipstick and the number for the shade. The caps twist off and there’s a doe foot applicator. For some reason when I first went to open one, I pulled on the cap. It came right off, revealing a black cap (see photos). Luckily the cap cover went right back on and stayed on without issues. But, kind of weird it comes off like that. Like it’s not glued on or something? So, of course, I then had to see if they all pulled off like that....they did (see photos). 2 of them I thought weren’t going to come off (I was just pulling lightly, I didn’t want to force them off), but then they came off too. But, again, I’m just glad they went back on and stayed on without issue.<br \/><br \/>The tubes are small, so the doe foot applicators are small (see photos). The doe foot applicators are thin, longer rectangle shape, flat on each side. I liked them. They were small, but still easy enough to handle.<br \/><br \/>The colors are all extremely pigmented. They are all nice and smooth. They go on evenly. They don’t take long to dry. They last a good amount of time.<br \/><br \/>The only downside I see is the tubes are white, so they can get dirty easy.

It does not come with any directions in the tiny box so looking at the ad it says to boil for 20 seconds to help it shape to your mouth. That did nothing and I'm not sure exactly what it is supposed to form. It is not like a mouth guard that adjusts to your mouth. The piece is already shaped and firm with some give when pressure is applied.  It's kind of like a therapeutic squeeze ball for your mouth.

First off, it is literally dry, not in an aerosol type of container.  You screw open the top (like and elmers glue bottle) and shake onto your head. Well. The little safety piece of cardboard was not attached to the bottle but stuck in the lid.  I did not know this until I tried to use it to no avail.

When I did get to the point I could use it, it turned out to be so light colored and obvious on my head I had to work it well into my hair, brush and shake my head so it was not such a glaring product. I will admit it did a great job in \"thickening\" my very fine hair, but it really needs to come in colors; blonde, brunette, etc. so it is not so obvious.  Will I buy it again?

The strong perfumed scent is a little much to take sprayed directly on the face. However, when after toweling off from a shower, I sprayed this over my body, and even a little on my damp hair before blow-drying, with just a tiny spritz around my face, and it did much better—I smelled good and it’s not as strong as a regular perfume would be.)<br \/><br \/>I love facial mists. They soothe and calm my skin, and refresh my face, and my mood. I want to give this 4 stars because it seems to be a nice mist, but there are unknowns. I’m giving it 3 stars based on how I like the feel of it, and the scent, though strong, is nice but a bit much to spray in my face—<br \/><br \/>This Valjean face mist in Glow comes in a really nice heavy glass bottle—I like glass bottles because I can reuse them, or I can check to make sure they can be recycled, which is important to me. But reusing them by making my own face mist is nice—would be great if Valjean offered refillable options so once this bottle is emptied, I can put in more of the same product.<br \/><br \/>This mist feels amazingly refreshing. You’ll need to note that it has a pretty strong scent. And the scent is kind of a perfume scent; that was a surprise to me. I wasn’t sure I liked that at first, and still I have to be careful when I spritz it.<br \/><br \/>However, I like this scent. And though it can seem to be strong when I first spray it, it doesn’t overpower me or linger too long. If you spray it and it lands on your clothes, the scent will linger longer but it’s soft and I like the tones of the scent. But, again, on the face I have to be very careful.<br \/><br \/>There isn’t a lot of information about the company or the product on this Amazon page, which is puzzling, for I’d like to know a bit more about the product I’m putting on my face. I googled the company and couldn’t find much there either. Except for a dermatology site that indicated the same thing I did: why doesn’t this company list more about their products.<br \/><br \/>Am I just spritzing perfumed water on my face with a few minerals added? How much? What’s the perfume scent? They don’t even tell me what the scent is. However, on the back of the bottle is the list of ingredients and I suppose that helps. But I’d like more on this Amazon page, or that I can google.<br \/><br \/>To that end, I’ll continue to use the facial mist for times I need a boost in mood or I’m sweaty after a workout or it’s hot in the summer.","title":"Works better as a body mist because of the strong scent.","timestamp":1581084194114}

I never let the fact that I receive the products free affect my ratings. I always call the shots as I see them. This SUPRENT razor is the latest example; its stunning manifestation of idiotic product design catapulted it in one fell swoop to the top of my ignominious list of “Worst Products E-V-E-R!”<br \/><br \/>It’s so bad that I shan’t waste time enumerating its faults in detail, or in trying to be humorous or clever as I usually do in my reviews. This stinker doesn’t even warrant the effort it takes to make a bulletized list, but herewith I reluctantly give it that much attention:<br \/><br \/>- It’s too heavy to maneuver around the face or wherever.<br \/>- The head is too big for precise shaving in tight areas such as under the nose.<br \/>- The “38.5° Golden Shaving Angle” is the wrong angle for just about every surface.<br \/>- The worst of its many bone-headed “features” is that the chrome-plated zinc handle is too thin for a firm grip; it slips, slides and spins with Teflon-like frictionlessness in the hand, which is not only annoying but actually dangerous. How could it not occur to the geniuses who designed it that a mirror-smooth chromed metal surface with absolutely NO knurling, stippling or any other texture would be even MORE slippery when held in a wet hand with soapy shaving cream on it? Did anyone even try it out on a real face before they shipped it out the door?<br \/>- Speaking of shaving cream, the little can that comes in this set is useless. It’s as light and insubstantial as NASA Aerogel, and disappears to a thin oily layer when rubbed in. I don’t know what it is, but it’s NOT like any other shaving cream that I’ve ever used.<br \/>- The huge, unwieldy, six-blade head does NOT glide smoothly across the skin; the blades catch and grab at every opportunity, and do NOT shave closely.<br \/>- Since no blade replacements show up on Amazon, they’re clearly rare, hard to find and, if you can find them, no doubt they’re obscenely expensive.<br \/>- The stylish, oh-so-elegant “portfolio” that accompanies this set is the most pretentious thing that I’ve seen in a long time. I mean, it’s a RAZOR, not the latest iPad Pro!<br \/><br \/>Anyone who spends 50 bucks for this set rather than getting it for free will surely be wildly disappointed and probably furious once they realize what they got for their money. It’s not worth 50 cents. It’s all about form over function, with form checking in at 100% and function zero.<br \/><br \/>In the past, I’ve gotten some marginal razors through Vine, but none have been so bad that I’ve thrown them away rather than using them. This one is the exception.<br \/><br \/>The minimum-allowed one-star rating is far too generous for this “object” that, whatever it is, doesn’t qualify as a “razor” in any practical way.

These are quicker, easier, and nicer feeling than a wet rag. These aren't all that wet but I managed to wipe down both feet effectively enough. 14 wipes, individually wrapped. Suggested that only one wipe per foot.. so seven uses from this box.<br \/><br \/> The individual packets are convenient but wasteful if not using them on the go. I dont know how much benefit they offer beyond a basic wipe down. Non irritating, non drying. Not loving them enough to be a repurchase.","title":"wipes are ok.

I've been using a straight razor for some time, but these cartridge type razors are definitely easier to use and less likely to produce accidental cuts. I was excited to try this, and in general, it's been pretty good, but not amazing. The razor itself is quite heavy and looks very cool. The cartridge fits easily and is easy to change if necessary. There's also the heavy base piece to stand the razor up. The shaving cream is not that great. It comes out of the can with impressive body, but once you start applying it to your face, it deflates and just doesn't provide awesome coverage. The razor is smooth on the skin, but because of its asymmetrical design, it's less comfortable in the left hand. I'm right handed, but I still switch between hands when I'm shaving different sides of my face. It would have been better if they made it symmetrical. Overall, not really worth $50 despite the cool looks.","title":"Pretty good razor, so-so shaving cream. Not worth the price","timestamp":1633467665747}

The thin comb bristle brush is great for separation, especially on the lower lashes.  I've worn both for 36 hours and after massive eye rubbing, I am surprised at how fresh it looks. I awoke with no raccoon eyes and no need to reapply it today. it didn't flake off!

Too much is not a good thing, so all of the internet stuff recommending epsom salts are really bad advice. But, palm trees often need supplemental magnesium, so I got this. The effect takes time to show, so I am not going to lie and say my palms instantly look great, but this is a decent product and it should work just fine. But no, your tomatoes will not grow better if you add this.","title":"got them for my palm tree","timestamp":1618338675380}

They are all in small packaging, but you don't need to use a lot, so they should last a while. My opinion on each product differs a lot, so I'll provide a short review of each item.<br \/><br \/>*Instant Foaming Cleanser: I love this one. It's my favorite. It smells wonderful, and it just feels great going on my skin and after I've rinsed it off. You really don't need much. I found that if I pressed down the top about halfway, I got enough to cover my whole face. For me, the cleanser is definitely a 5-star product.<br \/><br \/>*Glycolic Peel Mask: While I felt like the mask did its job fine, I wasn't a fan of the smell at all. The best way that I can explain it is to say that it smells like wood to me. It's like I'm sniffing the bark of a tree. I'm not sure where that smell came from. It's not a horrible smell. It's just that I've had other masks that work just as well and have a more appealing smell. I'd probably give this one 3 stars.<br \/><br \/>*Spray Beauty Elixir: This one is the hardest for me to review. When I first used it, I did not like it at all. While I like the smell, it's a bit overwhelming. The first time I used it, it also stung in a few spots. I know that this isn't how it was meant to be used, but I found that for me, it works best when I spray it on my hands and then pat my face with it. After using it a few times, it started to grow on me, and it does seem to moisturize my skin well. I'd give this 4 stars.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this set evens out to 4 stars. It's a nice set, and if, like me, you haven't tried products by this brand before, this is a good way to sample them to decide what you like and what you don't like.","title":"Depends on the Item","timestamp":1605121665137}

One of the ridiculous things is suddenly discovering random hairs on my face. Tweezing is certainly effective, but takes forever and is tiresome.<br \/><br \/>This is the first little shaver of this type I've used. It needs a single AA battery that is not included. It's reasonably quiet when running, has a little light and is easy to hold. It is completely painless as advertised - this actually shaves rather than ripping hair out like those epilator things. It works well and I don't really have any complaints.","title":"Totally painless, needs a battery, but works as it should","timestamp":1538586113610}

Its very strong but not overpowering. Truly one of the best things I've smelt.<br \/><br \/>APPLICATION: Goes on fairly oily and blends pretty well. Immediately brings color to my face, I have medium skin and it starts with an apricot redness but fades back to an awakened tone. I really enjoy that about this, I see others complain about this so maybe it's not best for fair skinned people?.<br \/><br \/>Once dry, I am left with a matte sheen that is well hydrated. You expect it to feel oily but it's more like a raw feel. A really nice balance of hydrated but not wet and definitely softer. I really enjoy this product as well as their others I've tried and will happily continue to use this as my nightly regiment.","title":"Amazing scent.

This works exceptionally well. I have tried some of these little three-pronged brow markers in the past and never been very impressed. These have enough stability to them that you really can flick and get straight little lines that look just like hairs. They are thin and you have actual control. This formula also lasts forever! I definitely have to use makeup remover to get it off, so it is for sure waterproof. I also like that this color isn't pulling red on me. So often browns do that but this is nice and dark and definitely neutral. The only complaint I have is that when I open these there was a little bit of ink that had leaked out around the applicator at the top so it looked a little messy, but I love the way this works so much I don't care One thing to note is that it's best to put this on before you use any other wax or gels to keep your brow hairs in place. This really doesn't work well on top of anything but dry plain skin.","title":"This stuff looks great and it lasts forever on your eyebrows","timestamp":1620942843347}
